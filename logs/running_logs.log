by him\na such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely xiv any expenditure not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessed laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business profession or vocal ion\nin the statement of the case submitted by the Tribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of the company and the terms of the compromise mention de above the arguments urged on behalf of the assessed company have been recapitulated\nthe first argument was that under the first proviso to section a of the indian Income tax Act this payment was liable to be exempted\nthe Tribunal rejected that argument\nin the reference the High Court also rejected the same and it was not presented before us\nthe next argue men of the respondents was in respect of Rs\nof 500 it was entitled to exemption under section of a xiv of the Income tax Act on the ground that the payment was an expenditure which was not in the nature of a capital expenditure or personal expenses of the applicant company but was an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its bush ness\nthey urged that if the applicant company did not agree to pay this amount Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd could have brought a suit against the company to realise this amount due on the funds which would that S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 1013 1950 Ltd have exposed the applicant company to the public and in order to save themselves from the scandal and main tain the managing agency they agreed to

Noble Oalcutt\nAgency Ltd a the Tribunal found as facts a that the applicant company agreed to pay off the detrital amount from the remuneration which they are entitled K nia of J\na the decree to get from the Basanti Cotton Mills\nwas passed against the applicant company evidently for certain misfeasance committed by its directors and the applicant company agreed to pay it off from its remuneration\na the books of account of Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd would show that they were paying the applicant company in full its remuneration and the books of the applicant company also show that it a in the was entitled to its remuneration in full\ncircumstances the Tribunal held that the expenditure was not laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of carrying on the business\na besides the Tribunal was of the opinion that in this case it was not a revenue expenditure at all\nis the payment had to be made towards liquidation of the detrital amount the Tribunal held in the circumstances of this case that it was a capital payment\nin behalf of the res pendent it was argued in the further alternative that the Privy Council decision in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria a easel\nwould cover the present case\nthat contention was rejected by the Tribunal\nthis statement of the case prepared by the Income tax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its opinion was perused by the parties and they had no suggestions to make in respect of the same\nthe state men of the case was thus settled with the knowledge and approval of the parties\nwhen the matter came before the high Court Mr Mitra who argued the case for the present respondents as shown by the judgment of the high Court urged as follows of the applicant company had not agreed to pay the amount

cut\nAg nay the danger of public exposure and in order to save itself from the scandal and in order to maintain the managing agency the applicant company agreed to Kania o J deduct certain amounts from the managing agency commission and therefore such expenditure came with in section of a xiv of the Act\nthe High Court thereafter noticed several cases including 111 mitchell a case and towards the close of the judgment delivered by Chatterjea J observed as follows in this case it is clear that the agreement was entered into with a view to avoid the publicity of an action against the mana going agents and consequent exposure and scandal and in order to maintain the managing agency so that the company could carry on its business as before\nthe payment in question did not bring in any new assets into existence nor in my opinion can it properly be said that it brought into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of the company a trade\nthe Appellate Tribunal observed that the decree was evidently passed against the appellant company for certain misfeasance by its directors and the appellant company agreed to pay it off from its remuneration\nthe object of the agree\nmen was to enable the company to remove a defect in carrying on the business of the company and to earn profits in its business\ntherefore this case is covered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Mitchell a case Applying this line of reasoning the high Court differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and allowed the deduction to the respondent company under section of a xiv of the Income tax Act as claimed by the respondents\nthe Commissioner of Income tax West Bengal has come in appeal to us\nnow it is clear that this being a claim for exemption of an amount contended to be an expenditure falling under section of a xiv the burden of proving the a 1927 a K B\n719\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 1015 a Ltd Ka1ita C J necessary facts in that connection was on the assessed 1950 it being common ground that the commission was due of and had become payable and was therefore the business com a\na a income of the assessed company liable to be taxed in the assessment year\nthe jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of income tax references is an advisory Calcutta Agency jurisdiction and under the Act the decision of the Tribunal on facts is final unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for the conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribunal\nit is therefore the duty of the High Court to start by looking at the facts found by the Tribunal and answer the questions of law on that footing\nany departure from this rule of law will convert the high Court into a fact finding authority which it is not under the advisory jurisdiction\nthe statement of the case under the rules framed under the Income tax Act is prepared with the knowledge of the parties concerned and they have a full opportunity to apply for any addition or deletion from that statement of the case\nof they approved of that statement that is the agreed state\nmen of facts by the parties on which the High Court has to pronounce its judgment\nin the present case the parties perused the statement of case and as disclosed by the note made at the end of it had no sun questions to make in respect thereof\nit is therefore clear that it was the duty of the High Court to start with that statement of the case as the final statement of facts\nsurprisingly we find that the High Court in its judgment has taken the argument of Mr Mitra as if they were facts and have based their conclusion solely on that argument\nnowhere in the statement of the case prepared by the Tribunal and filed in the High Court the Tribunal had come to the conclusion that the payment was made by the assessed company to avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself from scandal or in order to maintain the managing agency of the appellant company\nthe whole con fusion of the High Court is based on this unwarranted assumption of facts which are taken only from the argument of counsel for the present respondents before 1016 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1950

in these matters a a a a a una is on a a visor an a a a a on facts are the conclusions on which the High Conrt is to exercise such advisory jurisdiction is illustrated it seems that unfortunately counsel for the respondents caught hold of Mitchell a case a and basing his argument on the circumstances under which a payment could be described as a business expenditure falling within the terms of section of a xiv argued that the facts in the present case were the same\ninstead of first ascertaining what were the facts found by the Tribunal in the present case the process was reversed and the procedure adopted was to take Mit as the law and argue that the facts in the cell a case a present case covered the situation\nin our opinion this is an entirely wrong approach and should not have been permitted by the High Court\nthe High Court fell into a grave error in omitting first to asker tain what were the facts found in the case stated by the Tribunal\nthe high Court overlooked that in Afitchell a case the whole discussion started with a quotation from the case stated by the Commissioners as the facts of the case\na scrutiny of the record in the present case shows Income tax Officer the assesses that before the claimed only a deduction of the interest of Rs\na 582 as a permissible deduction under section of a iii of the Income tax Act\nthat claim was rejected by the Income tax officer\nwhen the matter went to the Assistant Income tax Commissioner it was argued that the Income tax Officer was in error in not allowing the deduction of interest and was also wrong in not allowing the entire sum of Rs\nof 500 as a deduction on the ground that that portion of the income viz Rs\nof 500 should be treated as not earned or deemed to be earned by the assesses at all having regard to the decision of the Privy Council in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria a case\nthe first paragraph of the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner following contains the of a a a C\nof all 1927 a K B\n719\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS l017 1950 statement in disallowing this interest claim the Income tax Officer was following the decision of my predecessor in his order dated the with March 1942 in Oommimoner a\nAppeal No a a of 1941 of\nby predecessor other a red Nothmg is a evidence to show that the manager a agency company had surplus money and such money Calcutta Ag cd was invested or that there was any need to borrow\nthus the need to borrow is not established\nthere is no doubt that money was borrowed but less it can Kania a J to proved that the borrowing is for the purpose of the business and the loan was you see in the business the interest can not be allowed under section of a iii\nLtd\nthe second objection raised before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was in these terms that the Income tax Officer should have allowed the said sum of Rs\nof 500 as allowable expenditure being allow ion of a sum out of the revenue receipt before it became income in the hands of the assessed\nthe wording of the objection and the argument noticed in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner show that the contention was that this sum should be treated as not having become the income of the assessed at all because it was deducted at the source by the Mill company\nreliance was placed for this contention on Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria a case\nthe contention was rejected\nit the third stage when the assessed urged his content tons before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal he thought of urging as an argument that this was a per missile deduction under section of a xiv because of the principles laid down in Mitchell a case a\nto evidence it appears was led before the Income Tax Tribunal nor has the Tribunal recorded any findings of fact on which the principles laid down in Mitchell a case could be applied\nthe Tribunal a conclusions of facts were only as summarized in the earlier part of the judgment\nit is therefore clear that the necessary facts required to be established before the principles laid down in Mitchell a case a could be applied have not been found as facts in the present case at any stage of the proceedings and the High Court was in error in a a a C\nof\n130 19271 a K B\n719\n1018 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1950 Ltd 1950\nKania a\na come tax West Bengal a in applying the principles of Mitchell a case a on the assumption of facts which were not proved\nthe High OomI missioner of Court was carried away it seems by the argument of the counsel and through error accepted the argument indeed if it had noticed the contention as facts\nCalcutta Agenoy urged before the Income tax officer it would have seen at once that the argument was in a measure conflicting with that contention which was based on the foot in of Rs\na of 000 being a loan to the assessed on which it had to pay interest which was sought to be deducted under section of a iii of the Income tax Act\nin our opinion\ntherefore this appeal should be allowed on the simple ground that the facts necessary to be established by the respondents to support their claim for exemption under section of a xiv of the indian Income tax Act have not been established at any stage of the proceedings and therefore they are not entitled to the deduction claimed\nthe appeal is therefore allowed with costs here and before the high Court\nappeal

payment of objection raised both by Mr Das and Dr Ambedkar to the constitutional validity of the impugned statutes and such objection really amounts those laws in question on the ground that they contravened the provisions of article of a though learned counsel that they were relying on the prove stoutly denied signs of article of a\nthe denial however seems to me to be based on a quibbling distinction without a really difference in substance\ntheir main attack was grounded on the absence of these two essential re requisites of valid acqms1t1on of private property though Mr Das would deduce implication from entry of of List II and them by entry of of List III while Dr Ambedkar sought to derive them from the spirit of the constitution\nbut this is only a form of stating the objection which in that the statutes are bad because of the substance is absence of a public purpose and the omission to pro vide for a just compensation\nthis in fact was the of then these two burden

regards these require meets as to public purpose and payment of compel station are still enforced by the express provisions of article of a\nthe State a power of compulsory acquisition incur ported in the body of the Constitution from which estates alone are excluded it would in my opinion to elementary canons of statutory con be contrary striction to read by implication limit in conjunction tons

limitations on the very those to hus very the in of it is true that under the common law of eminent domain as recognised in the jurisprudence of all civil lived countries the State can not take the

is further enacted that no safe be made which takes away or bridges if made shall be void guards and any such law the words there can be no room for implication and acquisition of property must be

Legislature be displaced or overridden by they making a law under entry of of List III\nTha to to be put upon can not bear the interpretation sought them by Mr Das is clear from the fact that similar words do not occur in entry of of list a which confers on Parliament the power of making laws with respect to acquisition or requisitioning of property the purposes of the Union\nfor if the restrictive condo to public purpose and pay men of compensate tons as it then ion are to be derived only from those words must follow that in the absence of those words in entry of authorising acquisition or requisitioning of property without a public purpose and a provision for compensation\nto legislation suggested why parliamentary reason was requisitioning of with respect con i property is to be free restrictive tons while State legislation should be subject to them\nthe fact is that the law making power of both Parlia men and State Legislatures exercised only subject to the aforesaid two restrictions not by reason of anything contained in the entries themselves but by reason of the positive provisions of article of a and as laws falling under article of a or under articles of A and of B can not be called in question those are in a court of law for non compliance with visions such laws can not be struck down as union institutional and void\nparliament can make

as coupled with a duty to ever case them when an appropriate occasion their the power granted to a legislature to exercise arises make a law with respect can not be to any matter brought under that

could not be the subject of com pulsar acquisition as the obligation to pay compensate ion would practically into a turn such forced loan\nfor could the payment of of per cent of the face value of the arrears be regarded as compensate ion for the loss of the total arrears for refund of one half of a sum of money taken away could never make good the loss of the balance\nthe argument proceeds on a misconception\nwhatever may be the position as regards the acquisition of money as such it is not correct to say that a law made under entry of of List II can not authorise acquisition of chosen in action like arrears of rent due from the tenants which are covered by the term property used in article of\nit is equally fallacious to argue that a pay men in cash or in Government bonds of half the the seminar without leaves amount of such arrears it compensation for the balance\nto is unrealistic remained uncollected assume that arrears which had the seminar as over a period of years during which the advantage of summary remedies and landlord had so much other facilities money or money a worth in his hands when he was to cease to he a landlord and to have no longer those remedies and facilities\nwhen allowance is made for doubtful and irrecoverable arrears and the trouble and expense involved in the collection of the rest of them the payment of of per cent\nof the face value of the entire arrears must as it seems to me be considered reasonable and fair compensation for taking them over\nindeed the contention leaves one almost wondering what advantage the seminars would gain by seeking to overthrow a provision in the Act which may well prove beneficial to them\nhowever tilsit may be for indicated article of a bars a the to challenge on these two grounds and the objections

as cost of works of benefit to the riyals of such estate or tenure the net assets on which compensation is it was said that there was no evidence to show that it was usual for the seminars to such expenditure and that the deduction was a mere contrivance to reduce the compensation payable for the acquisition of their estates\nthe provision for there such deduction was the constitution\nthe argument fore fraud on the well established obligation of however overlooks the seminars irrigation to maintain and repair tanks and channels in the villages comprised in their in the estates\nis the Privy Council pointed out Madras elway Co v Zemindar of Carvatenagaram a the zemandars have no power to do away with these tanks in the maintenance of which large numbers of people are interested but are charged under indian law by reason of their tenure with the duty of are serving and repairing are obviously the works of benefit to the riyals of the estate and their cost which the seminars are thus under an obligation to bear is a perfectly legitimate deduction of in computing the net assets of the the estate\nseminars had in the past neglected that this duty the deduction before does not affect the propriety of determining the compensation payable to it is therefore idle to say that it is a mere contrivance for reducing the compensation\nthis apart if a have endeavoured to show payment of compensation is not a justiciable issue in the case of the impugned statutes having regard to articles of a of A and of B it is not open to the court to inquire whether a educ ion which results in reducing the compensation is in warranted and therefore a fraud on the constitution\nthem\nthese them\nas Lastly Mr Das turned his attack on section of a read with section of a a\nunder the

as being discriminatory payment of compensation and it was to overcome that difficulty that articles and of B were inserted in the constitution\nconceded by the learned Madhya Pradesh these malguzari lands could not be regarded that as estates within the meaning of read in Madhya Pradesh with the Tenancy Acts in force but he contended that inasmuch as article of B our ported to validate specifically the Madhya Pradesh Act among others and as that article was not limited in its application to estates the objection could not that prevail\nMr Somayya however submitted the opening words of article of B namely without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article of a showed that the mention of part the Ninth ocular statutes in article of B read with accordingly and that Schedule was only illustrative article of B could not be wider scope\nreliance in the dec was placed in support of this argument upon in Sibnath Banerji a case\nsion of the Privy Council a

necessary to examine briefly the origin of the power of the State on acquisition of property\nthe subject of this power is a sovereign power of the State\npower exercised to take property for public use has been since olden times\nKent speaks of it as an inherent sovereign power\nis an incident to the power of the State the requirement that property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation\nMr Broom in his work on Constitutional Law says Next in degree to the right of personal liberty is that of enjoying private property without undue interference that property or molestation and shall not be taken for public use without just compel station is but an aflirmance of the great doctrine est blushed by the common law for the protection of pro date property\nit is

power of compulsory acqms1 ion is described by the term eminent domain\nthis term seems to have been originated in 1625 by Hugo Grotius who wrote of this power in his work De Jure Belli it Pacis as follows is under the property of subjects the eminent domain of the State so that the State or he who acts for it may use and even alienate and destroy such extreme necessity property not only in the case of in which even private persons have a right over the property of others but for ends of public utility to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed ends that private should give way\nbut it is to be added that when this is done the State is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property\nto have intended the relationship between the individual a right to compensation and the sovereign a power condemn in Thayer a cases on Constitutional Law is discussed Vol\na a 953 mentioned on page a of Nichols on Eminent Domain in these words\nto is individual\nin but while this obligation thus well established and clear let to make compel station it be particularly noticed upon what grounded it stands viz\nupon the natural rights of the the the are hand the right of the State to take springs from a different source viz a necessity of government\nthese two therefore have not the same origin they do not come for instance from any implied extract between the State and the individual that the former shall have the property if it will make compensation the right is no mere right to are emotion and it has either no condition of compensation annexed

under it must be the of eminent domain when comic rated by money afterwards could be nothing for a or less than a forced loan and it is difficult to say Stat it comes under the head of acquisition or re questioning of property as described a entry of of List II and is embraced within its ordinary cannot action\nright it is said by the learned Attorney General that the subject matter of acquisition in the present case is not money but chosen in action\nit seems to me that there is no difference in principle between them because a the acquiring chose in action can be available authority only when it is made to produce money otherwise it is useless altogether a\nto Assuming however that entry of of List II is wide enough to include acquisition of money or a right of action a have no hesitation in holding that in Qr did in for compensation in respect of such acquisition the legislature has made a honourable use of entry a a of List III and has thereby defeated the purpose of that speaks of

which such compensation is to be given\nthis is a describe ion of legislative head and a agree with the learned Attorney General that in deciding the competency of the legislation under this entry we are not concerned with the justice or propriety of the principles upon which the assessment of compensation is to be made under a part ocular legislation nor are we concerned with the justice or otherwise of the form or manner in which such a do not however compensation is agree with the the reasons already given by my learned brother in his judgment that legislation under this head need not pro vide for any compensation at all and that a legislative provision which declares that no compensation is to be given comes within the ambit of this legislative head\nsuch construction is repelled by the very language of the entry which speaks of giving compensation and not of denying or withholding it\nStripped of all dis guise the net result of the impugned provision is that it would be open to the State Government to approx private to itself half of the arrears of rent due to the landlord prior to the date of the acquisition without giving him any compensation whatsoever\nmaking of the whole and returning a half means nothing more or less than\ntaking half without any return and this is naked confiscation no matter in whatever specious form it may be clothed or disguised\nthe impugned provision therefore in reality does not lay down any principle for determining the compensation to be paid for acquiring the arrears of rent nor does it say any thing relating to the form of payment though appear entry it purports to determine both\nthis in my opinion is a fraud on the Constitution and makes the legislation which is a honourable one void and in operative\ncon tended that it is beyond the competency of the Court to enter into a question of bona fides or male fides of of the lewis in a sense this is true\nthe legislature\nnature is omnipotent to i a motives which impel it to enact a particular law are absolutely irrelevant arid learned Attorney General has the 1952 the State of Bihar a Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others\nMu of here\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 963 by on the other hand if it lacks competence the question of motives does not at all arise\nbut when a lewis late re has a limited or qualified power and has got to act within a sphere circumscribed legislative entries the question whether in purporting to act under these entries it has in substance gone beyond them and has done certain things which can not be accomplished within the scope of these entries is really a question affecting the competency of the legislature\nin such cases although the legislation purports to have been enacted under a particular entry if it is really outside it it would be void a\nit has been suggested in course of the argument on behalf of the State that in the present case the Government in the exercise of its powers of acquisition could acquire the arrears of rent and as the arrears were still unrealised it was to quite legitimate and proper for the Government deduct half of the gross amount as consideration for the trouble and expense that it would have to undergo in the matter of realising these arrears\nthis would that what the legislature intended is simply to mean enable the Government to help zamindars in realising the arrears of rent and as a return for the help which it is to the render the Government right to retain half of the arrears that were actually due\nthis could not possibly have been the real in mention of the legislature and a do not think that there is any item in the long legislative lists framed by the Constitution which empowers to inter fere with the legal rights of the landlord in this manner apart from special circumstances indebtedness or otherwise and impose upon him an onerous obligation to which he is not a consenting party\na legislation of this character is a complete novelty the like 0PS which has seldom been witnessed before\nthe result that a concur in the order which has been made by my learned brother Mahajan J in this case and a allow the appeals subject to

arguments based on entry of in List II and entry of in List III and holds the respondents barred from going into the question of compensation by reason respondents are of articles of a of A and of B still entitled to challenge the Act on the ground that the proposed acquisition is not for a public purpose\nthe C the Act constitutes a fraud on the Constitution that is to say while it purports to

article of a imposes upon a acquisition of private pro law for party the obligation to provide for compensation and provision of that such obligation article of a is not challenged\nfor is it claimed

bridges the provisions of those other parts of the Constitution for that ground of challenge has not been taken away by articles of a of A and of B by reason of the delimiting words used therein\nthe argument is developed in the following property way\nthe State a power is in essence a power to compel the owner to sell his property when the public interest requires it\nAutho city for this proposition is to be found in Blackstone a Commentary Broom a Edn\na 165 and in Cooley a C institutional limitations eth Edn Vol\nII a 1201 Footnote a\nindeed in some of the English statutes for

pulsar acquisition of private property without a pro its vision equivalent value to compulsory acquisition of pay just compensation for private property is a principle of natural equity re cognized by all temperate and civilized governments that the right to compensation is an incident the to the exercise of the power of eminent domain and that one is so inseparably connected with that the other

concept of a notes a compound concept namely power of taking on just terms and confines the very the legislative competency under those entries within of however the limits of word acquisition in entry of in List II and entry of in list a does not by itself imply the obligation to pay just compensation then urges Mr P R Das in the alternative the words subject the provisions of entry of of List III occurring at the end of entry of in List II certainly brings in that obligation\nin to a plain reading of entry of in List II the power make law with respect to matters specified therein is the subject to that is to say exercise of legislative power under entry of in List III\nthose conclude no words Mr P R Das says import for compensation as provided the obligation to provide and in entry of in List III into entry of in last mentioned thereby enlarge the content of legislative head comprising entry so as to make it a he compound concept referred to above\nthe third alternative position is that if the word acquisition the in entry of in List II does not by the obligation to provide the words\nsubject of that obligation as stated import List above entry of in List III

constant to compulsory taking of private property by the State is can not be disputed\nthe first whether this obligate on is implicit in the term acquire ion as used in entry of in List II or in other words whether this obligation is inferred simply from the use of that term as a part of the content or mean in Attorney General a De Keyser a Royal in thereof\nhotel Limited supra Lord Dunedin pointed out that the power of acquisition was in its origin derived from the prerogative of the Crown and that the pay men of compensation was originally a matter of negotiation and bargain between the Crown

taken for public use without just compensation gave a constitutional recon nation to the right of eminent domain and to protect the subjects imposed a limitation on the exercise of that right by the State\nthis indicates the power of to pay compensation acquisition and the obligation are two separate and distinct concepts although the of the obligation to pay com second follows the

to be found in article of a in\nPart III of our constitution\nthe obligation to pay compensation may be introduced as a part of the a legislative power itself in which case it becomes composite power

treat the obligation to pay compensation as implicit in or as a part or parcel of these legislative heads themselves for it separately and expressly is of a\nthe well known provided in maxim express indeed a principle of logic and common sense and not merely a technical rule of construction See Broom a Legal Maxims with Edn a 443 at a 452\nthe law of express provision in article of a acquisition

of Mr P R Das a argument would lead to this animal us result to provide for compensation is made a part of the legislative power under entry of in List II by virtue of its last few words quoted above no such obligation is attracted and made part of the legislative power under entry of in list a and that therefore in making a law with respect in List a Parliament unlike the State Legislatures will not be bound to provide for any compensation at all\nthe intention of the framers this can not possibly be to acquisition of property under entry of the obligation that while of 1952 the State of

legislation\nall that the Court is concerned with is to see whether any principle has been laid down as mentioned in entry of in List III\nit is true that the percentage of costs of management calculated on the basis of the income of a big estate is less than that of a smaller estate but it is quite clear that the Act has fixed the scale of deduction under this head and under the head of works of benefit according to tenure impossible to say that the holder provision the for deduction for works of benefit riyals is not supported by any principle\na landlord is expected to spend money on works of benefit to his riyals a a providing irrigation charitable dispensary schools and so forth and be it said to the landlords that in practice they do spend money on this account\nthere fore

entry of in my judgment the Act can not be called in question on the ground of legislative incompetence of the Bihar Legislature to enact it under entry of in List II or entry of in List III\nthat a have stated above is sufficient to repel the the Act by first ground of attack Mr P R Das\nbut before passing on to the second main ground of attack a think it right to deal with a few subsidiary points canvassed before us\nlevelled against it is said that section a of the Act which is its main operative section does not contemplate or authorise the acquisition of arrears of rent at all for the notify cation under that section only refers to the vesting of the estates or tenures in the State\nit is however to be noticed that the consequence of issuing that notify cation is that the arrears of rent including all that are mentioned in clause a of section a are also to vest in the and be recoverable by the State\nthis vesting of arrears of rent in the State necessarily the implies transfer of the rights of tenure holders to the State and this process must therefore the State amount to the acquisition of Therefore the acquisition of the arrears of rent by the State\nthat right by the Act does contemplate the proprietors or in effect it in the authority of a passage in Willis Constitu tonal Law a 816 that the power of is argued eminent domain can not be exercised with respect to money and chosen in action besides certain other in is\nfounded on usual forms of property\nthis passage certain earlier decisions of the american courts\nit is however clear from Nichols on Eminent Domain the case of Cincinnati Vol\na a of paragraph a an a\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS that therein in action\nthat expression a Louisville N R Co a cited the that the right of eminent domain can modern view is in any case we are be exercised on chosen to consider whether arrears of rent are property in in our the sense a which Constitution and understood a our law\nthat are the arrears of rent but rents that have fallen due but have not been paid\nit is not at all money in the till of the landlord but it is a debt due by the tenants\nit therefore nothing but an actionable claim against is is undoubtedly a species of pro the tenants which party which is assignable\ntherefore it can equally be acquired by the States as a species of pro party\nto used 1952 the State of Bihar a Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others\nas\nin it the the section used a for taking this fifty per cent\nof taking of the estates or true is compensation taking of mines and minerals but not it is finally urged that the Act makes no provision item of for payment of compensation the of that property\nconnection is word tenures and also with the in con the the arrears of section with to the compel rent which are directed to be added station\nbut this prov1S1on for adding the fifty per cent\nof the arrears also appears in the chapter headed Assessment of Compensation the the process fifty per cent\nof the arrears of the compensation\nfurther assessment why is this fifth per cent\ngiven to the proprietors or tenure holders at all unless it were for compensation\nit to pointed out that when the State takes away a lac of rupees and returns of 000 rupees it in reality pays no compensation but by contra vance only the other of 000 rupees for nothing\nthis argument sounds plausible at first but is not founded on any good principle\nthis argument arises only because a moiety is paid back as it were of compensation for money were a the same com\nthe value of a made say by g1vmg some moiety of the money taken the same argument would that could be said not have been available and all and to added a takes away this shift therefore land of

would have been that the land so given not being equivalent in value to the money compulsorily taken away could not be JUSt compensation\nthat argument in view of articles of a of A and of B would of course have been futile\nbut a see no difference in principle or law when compensation for a acquisition of arrears is made in money\ncase if only a moiety of the amount of is returned the obvious complaint will be that the return is not fair or adequate compensation of of 000 rupees complaint for taking away Rs\na of 000 and may have prevailed had there been no provision like those we have in articles of a of A and of B\nthis the argument completely overlooks Apart from that the arrears of rent are not really cash in the fact the till of the proprietor or tenure holder but is only a the market value a by due by the tenants\nthat of this book debt\nthis debt will have to be realised possibly by suit followed by execution proceedings in solving time and money in costs\npart of it quite conceivably may not be realised at all\ntherefore the the risk of realising or not realising the State takes its arrears of rent but irrespective of efforts for the arrears is in a lump added to the compensation\nthis indicates clearly that compensation is in to my mind fact paid for the arrears of rent and a am not prepared to say that the payment of a moiety of the book debts as compensation is so illusory as to amount to nothing as contended by Mr P R Das\neven if it be inadequate the grievance will be not that no principle has been laid down in required by entry of in List III but that the principle so laid down does not produce adequate compensation and there is therefore a contravention of the provisions of article of a\nthat defect can not however be made a ground of attack in view of articles of a of A and of B for reasons sex planned above\nthe results of their realisation the fifty per cent\nof the Act as i Re Ground B the second point urged by Mr P R\nDas is that even if the

the existence of a public our pose is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition has not been disputed by the learned Attorney General\nthe contention put forward on behalf of the respondents is that the necks site for the existence of a public purpose as a condo to compulsory acquisition of private ion precedent property is not a provision 0PS article\nof a but is a requirement of entry of in List II or entry of in List III\nthe words for public purposes do occur in article of a but it is said that there is a distinction between a provision and an assumption\nit is urged that article of a assumes a law authorising the taking of possession or the acquisition of property for a public that the property shall not be purpose and provides taken possession of or acquired even for that public law also provides for compensate purpose unless that the only pro ion\nvision of article of author law rising the acquisition for a public purpose must provide of property provision only this for compensation and the that can not be made Act by reason of articles of a of A and of B of the constitution\nthis argument has favour with Reuben J and S K

is that in the absence of a public purpose the Bihar Legislature had no legislative com potency under those two entries to enact the impugn ned Act and that this ground of attack is still available a

quote with content following passage from the judgment of the approval Batchelor J\nand was lease of in a think rather General definitions are a to be avoided where the avoidance is possible and a make no attempt to define precisely the extent of the phrase public purposes in the say\nthat in my opinion the phrase whatever else it may mean must include a purpose that is an object or aim in which the general interest of the community as opposed to the particular interest of individuals is directly and vitally concerned\nlease it is enough to and it is well that no hard and fast definition was laid down the concept of public purpose has been rapidly changing in all countries of the world\nthe reference in the above quotation to the general for a 1915 L R\nof a a\nof\na of S C

individual far it follows that whatever furthers the general interests of the com unity as opposed to the particular interest of the in\nindividual must be regarded as a public purpose\nwith the onward march of civilization our notions as to the scope of the general interest of the community are fast changing and widening with the result that our old and narrower notions as to the sanctity of the private interest of individual can no forward time and must necessarily give way to the broader notions of the general interest of the community\nis unmistakably community\nthe shifting the from this modern trend and political philosophy is well reflected and given expression to in our constitution\nour constitution as a understand it has not ignored the individual but has endeavoured to

to secure to all citizens justice social economic and political and equality of status and of opportunity\nthat were regarded only yesterday so to say as fantastic formulae have now been accepted as

agrarian reforms and amelia rating the conditions of the tenants\nthe object is inter asia to bring the tillers of the soil in direct con tact with the states so as to free them from the clutches rapacious landlords and make them the masters of of their holdings subject to payments of the dues to the State\nit is well known that the bulk of the tenants are in arrears with their rents and once the rents fall find it difficult to pay the into arrear the current rent after liquidating a part of the arrears so that while they clear part of the old arrears the current rent falls into arrear\naccording to annexure B a to the affidavit of Lakshman Nidhi affirmed on J anu are of 1951 the total amount of Raiyati rent payable by the various tenants in the different circles of the

under the guidance of the Land Com mission than from the expropriated landlords whose sole surviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only be to realise as much of the arrears as they can from the tenants and within time without any mercy or accommodation\nthe same re marks apply to the acquisition of decrees for arrears of rent\nthe overriding public purpose of ameliorating the conditions

integral part of the scheme and inextri indeed it may well have cable interwoven with it\nbeen that reform was not considered by the Bihar Legislature to be at all cape be of easy the State without the acquisition of the arrears of rent\nis however a have taken the view that no par to of the Act is bad for want of a public purpose a need not pursue any further the question of the separability of the Act or to refer to learned counsel on relied on by the judicial decisions both sides\nthe scheme of agrarian implementation by and the requirements Re Ground C Mr P R Das a third point is that the Act constitutes a fraud on the constitution that is to say while it purports to be in conformity with the constitution it in effect constitutes a defiance of it\nthe Act according to him pretends to comply in that it sets with the constitutional out to lay down certain principles on which compel form and the station is to be determined manner in which such compensation is to be given but in effect makes out a scheme for non payment of compensation\nthe Act he urges purports to pay back fifty per cent\nof the arrears of rent as compensate ion but in reality confiscates the other fifty per cent\nwithout any compensation\nfurther under the guise of deducting a to of per cent\nof the gross income the State is in reality appropriating a large sum under tell head\nall this he concludes is nothing but are hence or a mere shift and contrivance for confiscating argument when properly private property\nto understood will be found resolve itself into an attack on competency of the Bihar legislative the Legislature to pass this Act\nin ultimate analysis it that while amounts pretending the Act does not really give it\nit is the absence of a provision to nothing more give compensation than saying the to 1952 the State of Bihar a Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others\nDas of S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 1003 just and compensation according that may for adequate and to Mr P R the Act bad because power under entry of in List the legislative Das II and entry of in List III requires the making of such a prov1S1on\nthe failure to comply with this constr national condition for the exercise of legislative power may be overt or it may be covert\nwhen a is overt the law is obviously bad for non compliance we say with the requirements of the Constitution that is to say the law is ultra virus\nwhen however the non compliance is covert we say that it is a fraud on the Constitution the fraud complained of being that the Legislature pretends to act within its power while in fact it is not so doing\ntherefore the charge of fraud on the Constitution is on ultimate analysis nothing epigrammatic way of express but a picturesque sing the idea of non compliance with the terms of the constitution\nmake the case of the acquisition of the a rears of rent\nit is said that the provision in the Act for the acquisition of arrears of rent is a fraud on the lewis native power given by the constitution\na ask myself as to why must it be characterised as a fraud\na find nothing in the Constitution which says that the arrears of rent must not be acquired and therefore there is no necks site for any covert attempt to do what is not prohibit de\nthat in a scheme of land forms such as is envisaged in the Act the acquisition of the arrears of rent may properly accompany the acquisition of the zamindaries and the tenures\nthere then does this theory of fraud come in\nthe answer must eventually be that a moiety of arrears are taken away without compensation\nagain take the case of the properties\nwhy a ask is it called a fraud on the constitution to take such property\ndoes the Constitution prohibit the acquisition of such property\nobviously it does the fraud\nthe answer that not\nthere then comes to my mind is that it is fraud because the Act the basis of income provides for compensation only on at present and non income yielding rich very therefore properties which a have already explained non income yielding but whip a are have acquisition of is 1952 the State of Bihar a Maharaia dhiraia Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others\nDas a 1004 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 19521 is in Lisit III but attractive provision attacked on required by to do what compensation for the ground that the Rayats\nin ultimate any compensation potentialities are acquired without at all\nsimilar answer becomes obvious in connect the deduction of a to of per cent\nof ion with the head Works of Benefit the gross assets under to therefore analysis the Act is really it the Constitution fails the to do namely to\nprovide for is therefore ultra acquisition of the properties and virus\nthis to my mind is the same argument as to the absence of just compensation in a different form and expressed in a picturesque and lang the question of a have already dealt with age\nabsence of a for just compensation while dealing with Mr P R Das a first point and a repeat that the obligation to provide for compensation is not itself or read with implicit in entry of List II by entry of is to be found only in article of a that under entry

principles so laid down elicit\nin these entries\nin the Act do not in any rare case produce any com adequate compensation sensation or do not produce in some cases such absence of compensation may be a contravention of article of a but in view of articles of a of A and of B and particularly due to the words notwithstanding anything in this Constitu ion occurring in article of a it can not be made a ground of attack on the Act even though such ground is formulated in a different but attractive language namely as a fraud on the constitution\naccordingly this point must also be a however repeat that if a took a different view a would still have the same difficulty as to the inseparability of the different provisions hereinbefore indicated\nrequirement said to be incompetency for the Act

by the late Chief learned brothers to which Mr P R Das has referred a have to overrule same\nhere section of clearly his contention all the indicates that the Legislature has applied its mind to the problem and it has laid down the principle that the compensation may be paid in cash or in bonds or and that if a party in cash and partly in bonds to be made payment is either wholly or partly in

1950\nin the face of these all to insuperable obstacles Shri P R\nDas candidly admitted that he could urge nothing as regards the adequacy or the illusory nature 0PS the\ncompensation provided in the Act if he was not able to convince the Court on his main point that he could challenge the offending Act on grounds other than those mentioned in Part III of the Constitution and that there was something in entries No\nof of the State List and No\nof of the Concurrent List read together which imposed on the State Legislature an obligation to provide for the payment of just or pro per compensation and that the non observance of this a S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 1013 obligation entitles him to challenge the validity of the Act as unconstitutional\nthe acquisition of property can only be for a public purpose\nunder the Land Acquisition Act a of 1894 a declaration by the Government that land is needed for a public purpose shall be conclusive evidence that the land is so needed and courts can not go into the question whether the public purpose has been made out or not\nthere is no such provision in any article of the Constitution with which we have to deal\nit is true that sub clause a of article of speaks of pro party being acquired for public purposes\nthe bar created by sub clause a of article of relates to the contravention of the provisions of clause a\nthe provision of clause is only as regards compel a station as can be gathered from its latter part 1952 the State of Bihar a Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others\nC handrasek hard Aiyar\nunless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given\nit is assumed rightly that the existence of a public purpose is part and parcel of the law and is inherent in it\nthe existence of a public purpose is not a pro article of a as a imposed by VlSlOn or condition limitation on the exercise of the power of acquisition\nthe condition prescribed is only as regards compel station\narticle of a dears the challenge of the con situation amity of an Act on this ground but no other\nwhether there is any public purpose at all or the the the purpose stated is such a purpose is open in my opinion to judicial scrutiny or review\nwhen the legislative declares that there is a public purpose behind the legislation we have of course to respect its words\nthe object of the Act in question intermediaries like interests of is to extinguish zamindars proprietors and estate and tenure holders etc and to bring the actual cultivators into direct relations with the State Government\nto achieve this the end several provisions have been enacted the for 1952 Tiu State of Bihar a Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhan a and others\nChandrasekhara Aiy a\n1014 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1952 transfer and the vesting of such interest a the State it is impose able as regards various items of properties\nto deny that the Act is inspired and dominated by a public purpose but the question still remains whether the taking over of particular items can be said to be for a public purpose\nit is in the connection that the two items of arrears of rent and cost of works of benefit to the riyals dealt with in section a clause a and section of clause of respectively of the Act have to be considered\nto the some relation zamindars proprietors or the taking over of arrears of rent does not seem to have even a remote connection with any question of it stands on no better footing than if land reform\nthe Act sought to take over the cash on hand or in the banks of the tenure it is only an accident that the rents in ques holders\nion were not realised before the passing of the Act\nWhether realised or not they are his moneys due and roots\nthe consequences of payable to him by vesting of estates must have the tenures themselves and have some connection remote though it may be with the agrarian reforms under taken or contemplated\nsupposing that we have a legislation stating that as it is necessary to eliminate revenue and to paper rent collectors and ion and distribute land on an equitable basis amongst the\ntillers of the land and confer on them rights of permanent occupancy and also to bring them directly into contact with the State all moneys which the pro printers had collected as and by way of rent from their estates for three years prior to the commence men of the Act shall vest in and be payable to the State could it be said by that any public purpose had been established for the taking of the moneys\narrears of rent stand on no better them over is footing\nany public purpose that its absence\nconspicuous by resort was had to for augmenting the financial resources of the State or for paying com sensation to the smaller proprietors out of this part individuals ocular in taking it is fairly obvious any stretch of reason item of acquisition\nthe arrears either Property of farmers of S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 1015 can not be appropriate a by the State in her the power of eminent domain for the mere purpose of adding to its revenues taxation is the recognised mode to secure this end\nof the latter was the real object it must be\nobserved that to take one man a property compulsorily for giving it away to another in discharge of Govern men a obligations is not a legitimate and permissible exercise of the power of acquisition\n1952 the State of Bihar a Maharajit dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others\nChandrasekhara Aiyar\nis be the a either arrear of the public purpose Sub clause a of section of no doubt provides that of per cent\nof the arrears of rents shall be added to the amount of compensation\nthis means one of two things the other of of taken without is confiscation is payment of any compensation which the con taken as virtually or a of per cent\nrent lump sum validated value of in action or the acquisition of chosen payment for actionable claims\ntaken either way it is difficult to consists\nWhether see wherein moneys could compulsorily acquired at all by a State is a moot question\nwillis say a in his Constitu tonal Law at page 816 while as stated above any and all property is in general subject to the ever case of the power of eminent domain there are certain forms of private property which can rather unusual these are corpses money chosen not thus be taken\nin its the government in action property used by governmental capacity property to be used for a mere substituted ownership unless such substituted owner ship i a a more necessary use and perhaps trust pro party dedicated liens and suits to a State mortgage to quiet title\nunder the heading what property is subject to the right Cooley observes in Vol\nII of his book on constitutional limitations at page 1117 from however must be excepted this that which in ordinary use passes as such money or and which reach by taxation the Government may and also rights in action which can only be available when made to produce money neither of which can to take under this power\nin the foot it be needful note he points out statement 1952 the State of Bihar i Mahtwaia Jhiraja Sir Kameshwar\nSingh of Darbhanga and others\nChandrase hard Aiyflr\n1016 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1952 of under the right making money eminent domain when it must be compensated in money after wards could be nothing more or less than a forced loan only to be justified as a last resort in a time of extreme peril where neither the credit of the govern men nor could be made available\npower of taxation the Nicols in his work on eminent domain does not disagree with this view on the other hand he says at page 100 of Vol\na paragraph a\na a so and that least upon it has far as implied inherent limitation upon concerned the objection the question has taken by eminent arisen whether money can be been domain held or intimated at a state in or a private corporation is is it is not not subject such taking\nto based on an the difficulty of power of government but that would be of any taking of money effecting a service to the Con the public without violating situation\nthe use for which it was needed might well be public but as compensation must be paid in money and if not in advance at least with such sex edition as conveniently may be had the seizure of money without compensation or with\nan offer of pay men in notes bonds or merchandise in other words a forced sale or loan however it might be justified by dire necessity would not be a constitutional exercise of the power of eminent domain\nthe the learned Attorney General sought to justify this the ground that it was a compulsory acquisition on taking of chosen in action\neven so they stand on the same footing as money of less value no doubt than if they were coin or currency notes\nit seems that chosen in action too can not be so acquired reference has been made already to Cooley a observations\nthe two cases Long Island Water Supply Company a City of Brooklyn and City of Cincinnati a Louisville Nashville Railroad Company do not former case support the in the contrary view\na 166 YOU S 685 of L Ed\nup\na 165\na 223 YOU S 389 of L Ed\n481 a

figure\nthe company objected to the acquire ion on the strength of article a Paragraph of of the YOU S Constitution which to the obligation of contracts pass a and was not due process of law as required by the Supreme the with amendment\nCourt confirmed rejected and impairment of there was that the argument the contract\nMr Justice Brewer points out that the contract is a mere incident to the tangible property and that it is the later which being fitted for public the contract is not the thing uses which is sought to be condemned and its impairment if impairment there be is a mere consequence of the in the present appropriation of the tangible property\nthat the taking over of cases it is untenable arrears of rent is a natural consequence of the acquire ion of the estates\nin error condemnation condemned\nany State impairing to state forbids any law the is in the latter case a railroad company filed a suit to condemn a right of way for an elevated railroad track across the

contract forbidden by the with section of the first article of the Constitution of the court through Mr Justice Lurton held the constitutional inhibition upon any state law impairing the obligation of contracts is not a limitation upon the power of eminent domain\nthe obligation of a contract is not impaired when it is appropriated to a public use and compensation made therefor\nsuch an exertion of power neither challenges impairs its obligation\nboth are recon it validity nor it is appropriated as an existing enforceable nosed for impairment of its obi taking not an it is a contract\nof compensation be made no nation\nconstitutional right is violated\na to any it would thus be evident that they were not cases of the compulsory acquisition of chosen in action\nhoses in action unrelated tangible property can be useful for a public purpose only when converted into money\narrears of money are particularly so\nwhen it is said that money and chosen in action are exempt from compulsory acquisition it the ground that they are movable property but on the ground that generally speaking there could be no public our pose their acquisition\nis not on in the provisions in section of sub clause PS that a to of\nper cent\nof the gross assets can be deducted from the amount as representing cost of works of benefit to the riyals\nthis is an obvious device to reduce the gross assets and bring it down to as low a level as possible\nthe Act does not say that this charge re presents the expenditure on works of benefit or zamindars and proprietors improvements which were under any legal obligation to carry out and which the they failed to discharge\nfor are we told anything a figure which this\ndeducted sum\nit about the future destination of the legislature has said

special leave against the award of the Industrial Tribunal Bombay in a dispute between the Tata Oil Mills Co Ltd the company Bombay hereinafter\nreferred to as and its workmen in the matter of profit bonus or the year 1955 of\nthe dispute arose over a demand made by the workmen for payment unconditionally as bonus for the year 1955 of of a sum equivalent to four months wages salary for all employees drawing wages salary of less than is\n500 per menses\nthis dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal by the Government of Bombay by its order dated June of 1957\nthe company had already paid a\nmonths basic wages as bonus to its workmen and the real dispute was thus only about the remaining bonus for a month and half\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS a the ease of the workmen was that the company had of made record profits during the year and declared a z959 Others Co Ltd dividend of of per centum free of income tax the the Tata Oil Milli workmen were getting much less than the living wage and the dearness allowance was not sufficient to fill the its for in and gap and therefore profit bonus at the rate of four months basic wages should be granted\nthe company on the other hand contended that it was paying Wanchoo a graded scale of wages with annual and biennial increments and had already paid profit bonus for a months\nit was not possible for the company to pay more than that as bonus\nas the available surplus according to the Full Bench formula did not justify it\nit was also pointed out that though the company started as far back as 1917 the shareholders began to get dividends only from 1940 and therefore a dividend of of per centum free of income tax was in the circus stances not high\nthe company also claimed that in making calculations for the purposes of the Full bench\nformula certain items of extraneous income should not be taken into account\nnext it claimed that a profit of Rs\na las appearing in the accounts due to the change in the method of valuation was no real profit due to the efforts of labour and should not be taken into account in arriving at the available surplus\nlastly it also claimed that it was entitled to a per centum interest on the working capital including the a mount in the depreciation fund\nthe Industrial Tribunal disallowed the claim of the company on all these three points and after making relevant calculations came to the conclusion that there was a sufficient surplus available to permit the grant of bonus for al months calculated on basic wages and therefore awarded the same\nthe company thereupon applied for special leave to appeal which was granted and that is how the matter has now come up before us for decision\nbe shall first take the question of extraneous in come\nsix items were sought to be excluded by the company as extraneous income and they were these a SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a I959 Tht Tata Oil fills Co Ltd a its Worhn1tn and Others U1anchoo\ni Income earned by

though in the judgment it mentioned only in dispute\nitems i ii iii and i as apparently items in and a were not in dispute before it but while making calculations it seems to have lost sight of this and disallowed tell claim with respect to these two items also\nlearned counsel for the respondent a appearing before us has stated that the claim with respect to items in and a was con ceded by the workmen before the Tribunal and it seems to Jiat by over sight these items were not excluded by it\nbe fairly concedes that these two items may be excluded from consideration in making calculations for arriving at the available surplus\nbe are thus left with four items which were disallowed by the Tribunal\nthe reason given by the Tribunal for disallowing these items was that they formed part of the profits earned in the course of the company a business and there was no good reason for deducting them from the profits\nit further milt on to say that la regards income earned by way of rent\nlight and power it was not disputed that expenditure in respect of buildings from which the rent was derived such as on rep is and maintenance is included in the expenditure side of the account and taxes and rates for these buildings were paid by the company\nthere was thus no reason for deducting this amount from the profits\nit did not consider the S C R\nSUPREME COUR of REPORTS a other three items specifically and was content to include them on the general ground that they were the T a M all profits earned in the course of the company a business\nLtd\na Mr Daphtary appearing for the company has drawn z959 a Others anchor J our attention to a number of cases decided by indus its Workmen and trial tribunals as well as labour appellate tribunals where such items of income have been excluded on the ground that they are extraneous income unrelated Ve do not think it to the efforts of the workmen\nnecessary to refer to all these decisions and it is sun ancient to say that these decisions support the content ion put forward\nthe main reason given in these decisions for excluding what is termed as extraneous income is that they are unrelated to of the efforts of workmen\nVe may refer only to two of these decisions of the labour appellate tribunal in this connection\nin the Mill Owners Association Bombay a the Rashtriya a Mill Mazdoor Sangh Bombay a in which the all Bench formula was evolved the appellate tribunal renal red at page 1257 No scheme of allocation of bonus could be complete if the amount out of which a bonus is to be paid is unrelated to employees efforts\nthe Appellate Tribunal reiterated this in Shalimar RO be Works Mazdoor Union How1 a a Messrs Shali mar Rope Works Ltd Shalimar Howrah a by observe in at page 372 that it is however too late in the day to question tie view that there are profits in related to workers efforts and referred to as extraneous profits and that such profits must be left out of account in deciding the question whether there is available surplus in any particular year\nIncome received by way of rent of quarters and by sale of scrap materials has generally been treated as extra nexus income by the industrial tribunals on the basis of these decisions of the Labour Appellate Tribunal\nit is the correctness of this view which has been can a passed before us in this appeal\nreliance has also been placed by some tribunals on the decision of this Court in Muir Mills Co Ltd a Suti Mills Mazdoor a 1950 L L J U47\na 1956 II L L J\n371\na SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a r959 Union Kanpu1 a in this connection\nthis Court T ills M observed at page 998 as follows\nT ala it a a i co Ltd a there arc however two conditions which have to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justify of Wo kew and de and they are a when wages fall short of the living standard and a the industry makes huge pro fits part of which are due to the contribution which the workmen make in increasing production\nOthm Wanchoo of\nit was fort lies observed at page 999 it is therefore cole a that the claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as a result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the indus to ring concern has earned profits\nof in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss to here is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus\nH is clear from these observations that this Court was not de thing with the question of extraneous income as such in the al air fills Case a\nthe principles laid down in that case show that there must be profits in the particular year for which bonus is claimed result in in in available plus before profit bonus can be awarded\nit is only when profits are made that profit bonus can be 11w1trded subject to two further conditions a i rely a W ages fall short of the living standard and a the industry makes large profits part of which are duo to the contribution which the work men make in production\nit is this last condition which seems to have been relied upon by industrial tribunals in holding that there must be direct ctmnec ion between the efforts of labour and the profits and unless that direct connection is established the profits must be treated as unrelated to the efforts of labour and thus become extraneous income\nthere is no doubt that there must be contribution of the workmen in earning profits before they are entitled to profit bonus but it a a not laid down in the Muir Mills Case that direct connection between the efforts of the workmen and the particular item of profit earned must be established before the profit can be taken into account for the purposes of arriving at the available a 1955 a S C R\n991\nS C R\nSUPREME UOURT REPORTS a Oil M all a r959 Others Wanchoo\na Ltd a in carrying on that business it employs Th T surplus\nin industrial concern carries on a certain business\ncapita a as well as labour and generally speaking the profits earned in the normal course of business at the end of year are the result of the joint effort of capital its Workmen and and labour\neven so it may be recognized that there may be instances of extraneous income for the our pose of the all Bench formula due i either to some part of the profits not having beedegt earned in that year ii or to some part of profits arising out of fortuitous circumstances altogether unconnected with the efforts of labour\na third category may be the income arising out of sale of fixed or capital assets\nsuch income or profit may be called extraneous income as either it did not really arise in that year or though it has arisen in that year labour has not contributed anything towards its accrual it may therefore not be taken into account in calculations according to the Full Bench formula\nbut apart from these cases we can not see how income arising during the year in the normal course of business of the concern can be called extraneous income merely on the ground that no direct connection between the efforts of labour and the accrual of the income has been established\nin this very case we find an instance of the first category in two items relating to return of excess provision for expenses and refund of excess profits tax\nthese two amounts have gone to swell the profits of this year hut they have not arisen in this year and may there fore properly be treated as extraneous income\nin instance of the second kind is to be found in the profit of Rs\na las made in this year by a change in the method of valuation of the company a assets which is entirely unconnected with the efforts of labour\nbut so far as the other four items are concerned they are earned by the company in the normal course of its business and there is no reason why they should be excluded on the ground that it has not been proved that they are the result of direct efforts of labour in this year\nget us take these four items one by one\nthe first is the item of income earned by way of rent light and a SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a x959 co Ltd a Others anchor J power\nit is well known that many industrial concerns a he Tata Oil Mills provide amenities for their workmen by building quarters which are provided with light and power from the concern a power house\nthe quarters and its Workmen and power house are built out of capital or profits earned in past years\nof they are built out of a pita there is provision for a return which is generally at a per centum on the paid up capital\neven if they are built out of past profits the depreciation and rehabili station charges fall on the gross profits before the available surplus is arrived at\nbesides expenditure with regard to repairs and maintenance and rates and taxes is all paid out of the income of the concern before the gross profits are arrived at\nin other words these expenses are paid out of the profits in the earning of which the workmen have contributed their labour\nnow can the company claim to exclude the rent etc from the profits while meeting the expenditure relating to such assets out of the profits part of which is att reputable to the efforts of labour\nin short income by way of rent light and power arises in the normal course of business of the concern and there is no reason why a direct contribution by labour during the year in question must be insisted upon in the case of such income\nthe company must also be employing some labour for purposes of maintenance and repairs of the quarters aud power house even though the labour may not be wholly allocated to this work only\nbe are therefore of opinion that income from rent light and power arises in the normal course of business of a concern and can not be treated as extraneous income in the sense described above\nthe next item is estate revenue\nbe are told that the company has coconut groves which produce coconuts used in preparing oil which is one of the main items of the company a business\nbe are also told that sometimes the entire produce of these groves is not used in the manufacture of oil and therefore some part of the produce is sold\nthis income is out of this part sold in the market\nhere again the income arises in the normal course of business and the expenses for looking after and maintaining the groves are paid a S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS a by the company and entered into its account\nthe company must also be employing labour to look after the Tata Oil Mills the groves\nin these circumstances we fail to see why this income by sale of surplus coconuts should be excluded from the profits for the purpose of the Full its Workmen anal Bench formula\nco Ltd a Others z959 WanchooJ\nwhen we come to the profit on sale of empty barrels and sale proceeds of tin cans scraps logs planks bunnies etc\nthese items may be taken together for the nature of the receipt is the same though on account of the method of accounting employed the income in the case of barrels is shown as profit while in the case of scraps etc it is shown as sale proceeds\nit is said that this is extraneous income because it is unrelated to the efforts of labour\nbe can not accept this con mention for this income again is in the normal course of business\nfurther when the company buys chem call for example it pays for the chemicals as well as the containers namely the barrels\nwhen the chemicals are used up these empty barrels are sold\nwhatever is the income from the sale of these barrels is in reality a reduction in the cost price of chemicals to the company though by the method of accounting employed it may appear as profit on the sale of barrels\nbe see no reason why the reduction in cost price of chemicals should not be taken into account for the purpose of arriving at gross profits in making calculations for the Full Bench formula\nhome scraps are normally left over in the process of manufacture\nwhatever income is derived from such scraps also goes to reduce the cost price of materials used in production and thus to increase the profits\nbe do not see why this income arising in the normal course of the company a business should not be taken into account on the plea that labour has not directly contributed in its accrual\nbe are therefor of opinion that all these four items were rightly taken into account by the Tribunal in arriving at the gross profits\nwhen we come to the profit of Rs\na las made by a change in the method of accounting\nthe Tribunal did not accept this income as extraneous and in so doing it fell into error\nthis income of Rs\na las has a of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a Th T a a to to a of nothing whatsoever to do with the efforts of labour 959 Oil M all even though it has arisen this year\nit has arisen out co Ltd ala of a for a us circus once masque as is year there was a change in the basis of valuation of stock\na its Workmen and it is not income in the normal course of business because it is not likely to arise ever again\nin the circumstances this income of Rs\na las must be treated as extraneous income and excluded for the purpose of calculations based on the Full Bench formula\nWanchooj the Others a to\nthe last item with which we are concerned is the return on the amount of depreciation reserve used as working capital\nin affidavit was made on behalf of the company that it had used its reserve funds com prising premium on ordinary shares general reserve depreciation reserve workmen a compensation reserve employees gratuity reserve bad and doubtful debt reserves and sales promotion reserve as working capital\nthe Tribunal however allowed return at a per centum on a working capital of Rs\nof of las\nthis excluded the depreciation reserve but included all other reserves which were claimed by the company and having been used for working capital\nthe Tribu al gave no reason why it excluded the amount of the depreciation reserve in arriving at the figure of work in capital\na return is allowed on the reserves used as working capital on the ground that if these reserves are not used for this purpose the concern would have to borrow money and pay interest on that\nthis being the basis on which a return on reserves used as work in capital is allowed there is no reason why if there is in fact money available in the depreciation reserve and if that money is actually used during the year as working capital a return should not be allowed on such money also\nfurther if the money has been con vertex into such assets as stock in trade and stores etc i a other than capital or fixed assets it will be obviously available from year to year to that extent as\nworking capital subject to adjustments on account of loans secured or otherwise\nlearned could for the respondents wanted to contest that the whole amount in the depreciation reserve was not available for being used as working capital\nit is enough to say that the S C R\nSUPREME coURT REPORTS of z959 Others co Ltd a affidavit of the Chief Accountant filed on behalf of the co any was not challenged before the Industrial the Tata Oil Mills Tribunal on behalf of the respondents\nit would therefore be impossible for us now to over look that affidavit particularly when the Tribunal gave no its workmen and reason why it treated the working capital as Rs\nof of las only\nto far therefore as the present year is con corned we must accept the affidavit and hold that the working capital was Rs\n139 of las\nit will however be open to the workmen in future to show by proper cross examination of the company a witnesses or by proper evidence that the amount shown as the deere citation reserve was not available in whole or in part to be used as working capital and that whatever may be available was not in fact so used in the sense in the present appeal however we explained above\nmust accept the affidavit of the Chief Accountant\nthe Tribunal allowed a per centum interest on the working capital and that must be allowed on the total sum of Rs\n139 of las\nWamhoof\nbe now come to the calculations in accordance with the Full Bench formula subject to what we have said above

what the company has paid\nthere are three sharers in the available surplus namely the industry share holders and labour\nin the circumstances no case has been made out for increasing the profit bonus

award of the Industrial Tribunal Bombay in a dispute between the Tata Oil Mills Co Ltd the company Bombay hereinafter\nreferred to as and its workmen in the matter of profit bonus or the year 1955 of\nthe dispute arose over a demand made by the workmen for payment unconditionally as bonus for the year 1955 of of a sum equivalent to four months wages salary for all employees drawing wages salary of less than is\n500 per menses\nthis dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal by the Government of Bombay by its order dated June of 1957\nthe company had already paid a\nmonths basic wages as bonus to its workmen and the real dispute was thus only about the remaining bonus for a month and half\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS a the ease of the workmen was that the company had of made record profits during the year and declared a z959 Others Co Ltd dividend of of per centum free of income tax the the Tata Oil Milli workmen were getting much less than the living wage and the dearness allowance was not sufficient to fill the its for in and gap and therefore profit bonus at the rate of four months basic wages should be granted\nthe company on the other hand contended that it was paying Wanchoo a graded scale of wages with annual and biennial increments and had already paid profit bonus for a months\nit was not possible for the company to pay more than that as bonus\nas the available surplus according to the Full Bench formula did not justify it\nit was also pointed out that though the company started as far back as 1917 the shareholders began to get dividends only from 1940 and therefore a dividend of of per centum free of income tax was in the circus stances not high\nthe company also claimed that in making calculations for the purposes of the Full bench\nformula certain items of extraneous income should not be taken into account\nnext it claimed that a profit of Rs\na las appearing in the accounts due to the change in the method of valuation was no real profit due to the efforts of labour and should not be taken into account in arriving at the available surplus\nlastly it also claimed that it was entitled to a per centum interest on the working capital including the a mount in the depreciation fund\nthe Industrial Tribunal disallowed the claim of the company on all these three points and after making relevant calculations came to the conclusion that there was a sufficient surplus available to permit the grant of bonus for al months calculated on basic wages and therefore awarded the same\nthe company thereupon applied for special leave to appeal which was granted and that is how the matter has now come up before us for decision\nbe shall first take the question of extraneous in come\nsix items were sought to be excluded by the company as extraneous income and they were these a SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a I959 Tht Tata Oil fills Co Ltd a its Worhn1tn and Others U1anchoo\ni Income earned by way of rent right and power ii

only in dispute\nitems i ii iii and i as apparently items in and a were not in dispute before it but while making calculations it seems to have lost sight of this and disallowed tell claim with respect to these two items also\nlearned counsel for the respondent a appearing before us has stated that the claim with respect to items in and a was con ceded by the workmen before the Tribunal and it seems to Jiat by over sight these items were not excluded by it\nbe fairly concedes that these two items may be excluded from consideration in making calculations for arriving at the available surplus\nbe are thus left with four items which were disallowed by the Tribunal\nthe reason given by the Tribunal for disallowing these items was that they formed part of the profits earned in the course of the company a business and there was no good reason for deducting them from the profits\nit further milt on to say that la regards income earned by way of rent\nlight and power it was not disputed that expenditure in respect of buildings from which the rent was derived such as on rep is and maintenance is included in the expenditure side of the account and taxes and rates for these buildings were paid by the company\nthere was thus no reason for deducting this amount from the profits\nit did not consider the S C R\nSUPREME COUR of REPORTS a other three items specifically and was content to include them on the general ground that they were the T a M all profits earned in the course of the company a business\nLtd\na Mr Daphtary appearing for the company has drawn z959 a Others anchor J our attention to a number of cases decided by indus its Workmen and trial tribunals as well as labour appellate tribunals where such items of income have been excluded on the ground that they are extraneous income unrelated Ve do not think it to the efforts of the workmen\nnecessary to refer to all these decisions and it is sun ancient to say that these decisions support the content ion put forward\nthe main reason given in these decisions for excluding what is termed as extraneous income is that they are unrelated to of the efforts of workmen\nVe may refer only to two of these decisions of the labour appellate tribunal in this connection\nin the Mill Owners Association Bombay a the Rashtriya a Mill Mazdoor Sangh Bombay a in which the all Bench formula was evolved the appellate tribunal renal red at page 1257 No scheme of allocation of bonus could be complete if the amount out of which a bonus is to be paid is unrelated to employees efforts\nthe Appellate Tribunal reiterated this in Shalimar RO be Works Mazdoor Union How1 a a Messrs Shali mar Rope Works Ltd Shalimar Howrah a by observe in at page 372 that it is however too late in the day to question tie view that there are profits in related to workers efforts and referred to as extraneous profits and that such profits must be left out of account in deciding the question whether there is available surplus in any particular year\nIncome received by way of rent of quarters and by sale of scrap materials has generally been treated as extra nexus income by the industrial tribunals on the basis of these decisions of the Labour Appellate Tribunal\nit is the correctness of this view which has been can a passed before us in this appeal\nreliance has also been placed by some tribunals on the decision of this Court in Muir Mills Co Ltd a Suti Mills Mazdoor a 1950 L L J U47\na 1956 II L L J\n371\na SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a r959 Union Kanpu1 a in this connection\nthis Court T ills M observed at page 998 as follows\nT ala it a a i co Ltd a there arc however two conditions which have to be satisfied before a demand for bonus can be justify of Wo kew and de and they are a when wages fall short of the living standard and a the industry makes huge pro fits part of which are due to the contribution which the workmen make in increasing production\nOthm Wanchoo of\nit was fort lies observed at page 999 it is therefore cole a that the claim for bonus can be made by the employees only if as a result of the joint contribution of capital and labour the indus to ring concern has earned profits\nof in any particular year the working of the industrial concern has resulted in loss to here is no basis nor justification for a demand for bonus\nH is clear from these observations that this Court was not de thing with the question of extraneous income as such in the al air fills Case a\nthe principles laid down in that case show that there must be profits in the particular year for which bonus is claimed result in in in available plus before profit bonus can be awarded\nit is only when profits are made that profit bonus can be 11w1trded subject to two further conditions a i rely a W ages fall short of the living standard and a the industry makes large profits part of which are duo to the contribution which the work men make in production\nit is this last condition which seems to have been relied upon by industrial tribunals in holding that there must be direct ctmnec ion between the efforts of labour and the profits and unless that direct connection is established the profits must be treated as unrelated to the efforts of labour and thus become extraneous income\nthere is no doubt that there must be contribution of the workmen in earning profits before they are entitled to profit bonus but it a a not laid down in the Muir Mills Case that direct connection between the efforts of the workmen and the particular item of profit earned must be established before the profit can be taken into account for the purposes of arriving at the available a 1955 a S C R\n991\nS C R\nSUPREME UOURT REPORTS a Oil M all a r959 Others Wanchoo\na Ltd a in carrying on that business it employs Th T surplus\nin industrial concern carries on a certain business\ncapita a as well as labour and generally speaking the profits earned in the normal course of business at the end of year are the result of the joint effort of capital its Workmen and and labour\neven so it may be recognized that there may be instances of extraneous income for the our pose of the all Bench formula due i either to some part of the profits not having beedegt earned in that year ii or to some part of profits arising out of fortuitous circumstances altogether unconnected with the efforts of labour\na third category may be the income arising out of sale of fixed or capital assets\nsuch income or profit may be called extraneous income as either it did not really arise in that year or though it has arisen in that year labour has not contributed anything towards its accrual it may therefore not be taken into account in calculations according to the Full Bench formula\nbut apart from these cases we can not see how income arising during the year in the normal course of business of the concern can be called extraneous income merely on the ground that no direct connection between the efforts of labour and the accrual of the income has been established\nin this very case we find an instance of the first category in two items relating to return of excess provision for expenses and refund of excess profits tax\nthese two amounts have gone to swell the profits of this year hut they have not arisen in this year and may there fore properly be treated as extraneous income\nin instance of the second kind is to be found in the profit of Rs\na las made in this year by a change in the method of valuation of the company a assets which is entirely unconnected with the efforts of labour\nbut so far as the other four items are concerned they are earned by the company in the normal course of its business and there is no reason why they should be excluded on the ground that it has not been proved that they are the result of direct efforts of labour in this year\nget us take these four items one by one\nthe first is the item of income earned by way of rent light and a SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a x959 co Ltd a Others anchor J power\nit is well known that many industrial concerns a he Tata Oil Mills provide amenities for their workmen by building quarters which are provided with light and power from the concern a power house\nthe quarters and its Workmen and power house are built out of capital or profits earned in past years\nof they are built out of a pita there is provision for a return which is generally at a per centum on the paid up capital\neven if they are built out of past profits the depreciation and rehabili station charges fall on the gross profits before the available surplus is arrived at\nbesides expenditure with regard to repairs and maintenance and rates and taxes is all paid out of the income of the concern before the gross profits are arrived at\nin other words these expenses are paid out of the profits in the earning of which the workmen have contributed their labour\nnow can the company claim to exclude the rent etc from the profits while meeting the expenditure relating to such assets out of the profits part of which is att reputable to the efforts of labour\nin short income by way of rent light and power arises in the normal course of business of the concern and there is no reason why a direct contribution by labour during the year in question must be insisted upon in the case of such income\nthe company must also be employing some labour for purposes of maintenance and repairs of the quarters aud power house even though the labour may not be wholly allocated to this work only\nbe are therefore of opinion that income from rent light and power arises in the normal course of business of a concern and can not be treated as extraneous income in the sense described above\nthe next item is estate revenue\nbe are told that the company has coconut groves which produce coconuts used in preparing oil which is one of the main items of the company a business\nbe are also told that sometimes the entire produce of these groves is not used in the manufacture of oil and therefore some part of the produce is sold\nthis income is out of this part sold in the market\nhere again the income arises in the normal course of business and the expenses for looking after and maintaining the groves are paid a S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS a by the company and entered into its account\nthe company must also be employing labour to look after the Tata Oil Mills the groves\nin these circumstances we fail to see why this income by sale of surplus coconuts should be excluded from the profits for the purpose of the Full its Workmen anal Bench formula\nco Ltd a Others z959 WanchooJ\nwhen we come to the profit on sale of empty barrels and sale proceeds of tin cans scraps logs planks bunnies etc\nthese items may be taken together for the nature of the receipt is the same though on account of the method of accounting employed the income in the case of barrels is shown as profit while in the case of scraps etc it is shown as sale proceeds\nit is said that this is extraneous income because it is unrelated to the efforts of labour\nbe can not accept this con mention for this income again is in the normal course of business\nfurther when the company buys chem call for example it pays for the chemicals as well as the containers namely the barrels\nwhen the chemicals are used up these empty barrels are sold\nwhatever is the income from the sale of these barrels is in reality a reduction in the cost price of chemicals to the company though by the method of accounting employed it may appear as profit on the sale of barrels\nbe see no reason why the reduction in cost price of chemicals should not be taken into account for the purpose of arriving at gross profits in making calculations for the Full Bench formula\nhome scraps are normally left over in the process of manufacture\nwhatever income is derived from such scraps also goes to reduce the cost price of materials used in production and thus to increase the profits\nbe do not see why this income arising in the normal course of the company a business should not be taken into account on the plea that labour has not directly contributed in its accrual\nbe are therefor of opinion that all these four items were rightly taken into account by the Tribunal in arriving at the gross profits\nwhen we come to the profit of Rs\na las made by a change in the method of accounting\nthe Tribunal did not accept this income as extraneous and in so doing it fell into error\nthis income of Rs\na las has a of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a Th T a a to

change in the basis of valuation of stock\na its Workmen and it is not income in the normal course of business because it is not likely to arise ever again\nin the circumstances this income of Rs\na las must be treated as extraneous income and excluded for the purpose of calculations based on the Full Bench formula\nWanchooj the Others a to\nthe last item with which we are concerned is the return on the amount of depreciation reserve used as working capital\nin affidavit was made on behalf of the company that it had used its reserve funds com prising premium on ordinary shares general reserve depreciation reserve workmen a compensation reserve employees gratuity reserve bad and doubtful debt reserves and sales promotion reserve as working capital\nthe Tribunal however allowed return at a per centum on a working capital of Rs\nof of las\nthis excluded the depreciation reserve but included all other reserves which were claimed by the company and having been used for working capital\nthe Tribu al gave no reason why it excluded the amount of the depreciation reserve in arriving at the figure of work in capital\na return is allowed on the reserves used as working capital on the ground that if these reserves are not used for this purpose the concern would have to borrow money and pay interest on that\nthis being the basis on which a return on reserves used as work in capital is allowed there is no reason why if there is in fact money available in the depreciation reserve and if that money is actually used during the year as working capital a return should not be allowed on such money also\nfurther if the money has been con vertex into such assets as stock in trade and stores etc i a other than capital or fixed assets it will be obviously available from year to year to that extent as\nworking capital subject to adjustments on account of loans secured or otherwise\nlearned could for the respondents wanted to contest that the whole amount in the depreciation reserve was not available for being used as working capital\nit is enough to say that the S C R\nSUPREME coURT REPORTS of z959 Others co Ltd a affidavit of the Chief Accountant filed on behalf of the co any was not challenged before the Industrial the Tata Oil Mills Tribunal on behalf of the respondents\nit would therefore be impossible for us now to over look that affidavit particularly when the Tribunal gave no its workmen and reason why it treated the working capital as Rs\nof of las only\nto far therefore as the present year is con corned we must accept the affidavit and hold that the working capital was Rs\n139 of las\nit will however be open to the workmen in future to show by proper cross examination of the company a witnesses or by proper evidence that the amount shown as the deere citation reserve was not available in whole or in part to be used as working capital and that whatever may be available was not in fact so used in the sense in the present appeal however we explained above\nmust accept the affidavit of the Chief Accountant\nthe Tribunal allowed a per centum interest on the working capital and that must be allowed on the total sum of Rs\n139 of

be seen that more than half the available surplus has already gone to labour according to what the company has paid\nthere are three sharers in the available surplus namely the industry share holders

presented to the Appellate Tribunal by a by party which is aggrieved by the a ward omitting the words not necessary for our present purpose\nit is the usual statutory provision for an appeal which otherwise would not lie\nit does not say either in sex press terms or by necessary imply cation that those specific provisions of the Companies Act are abrogated or modified\nit does not do away with the necessity of the requisite sanction of the Court so far as a Liquidator is concerned\nunder the prove signs of the india Companies Act the affairs of the company under liquidation are placed in charge of the Official Liquidator and under a 457 it is only the Liquidator who is authorized with the sanction of the Court to institute any suit or other legal proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company\nthus there is no inconsistency between the aforesaid prove signs of the Act and the Companies Act which only laid down a condition precedent to the filing of an appeal if it has to be by a Liquidator of a company in the process of winding up\nit concerns a very special case and has no bearing on the general right of appeal\nis in the instant case the Court refused the necessary

party to the reference in his capacity as fie auction purchaser of the business of the company\nto far as that capacity is concerned it is clear from the order of the Tribunal that no award was made against him as such\nbe could not therefore be said to be a party aggrieved by the award having been exonerated from its terms\nthe Tribunal put this on three main grounds a that the auction purchaser had purchased the business of the Company free from all encumbrances out goings and liabilities a that though employment of the work men had been terminated by the Liquidators before possession of the business was delivered to the auction purchaser and a that there was no relationship of employer and employees between the auction purchaser and the workmen whose services were so terminated\nthe Tribunal in that view of the matter declared the Reference to be incompetent in so far as the auction purchaser was concerned\nThi order the Tribunal passed at the instance of the auction purchaser himself\nTh0 auction purclu1 ser therefore succeeded in obtaining the order which the Tribunal passed holding that the R florence so far as he was concerned was incompetent\nin view of these facts it must be held that so far as the auction purchaser is concerned he was not aggrieved by the Award made by the Industrial Tribunal\nthat being so the prove signs of a of of the Act are not attracted to the appeal purported to have been filed by the auction purchaser\nit is a little difficult to appreciate why the auction purchaser having succeeded in obtaining the order set out above in his favour

represented by Ispahani Employees Union hereinafter called the workmen\nthey will be disposed of by one judgment\nthere was a dispute between the company and its workmen on a number of matters which was referred by the Government of West Bengal to the adjudicate ion of the Second Industrial Tribunal by an order of December of 1953\nthere were a number of matters which had to be adjudicated upon but of these only two now survive namely\nwhether the workmen are entitled to puma bonus for 1953 and them under Messrs a whether the workmen are entity led to receive from the company any benefits for the period of service rendered by elf\nM Ispahani Ltd A few facts may be set out here to give the back ground of this dispute\noriginally there was another company called Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd which was carrying on business in Calcutta since December 1934 before the partition of India\nshortly before the part ion took place Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd trans feared their registered head office from Calcutta to Chittagong now in Pakistan\nthat company thus it became a Pakistani company after August 1947 however continued to own properties in India and carried on some business in Calcutta on a small scale\nthe company was incorporated on September of 1947 and took over the good will and trading rights of Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd and also purchased the stock in trade properties and assets of that company\nmost of the shares of the company were however held by Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd and the business of the company was of the same nature and was carried on in the same premises with the same telegraphic address I959 Jspahani Lid Calcutla a lspahani Employees Union Wanchoo\na S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of and with the same workmen on tell same remunerate ion\nfurther the company continued to pay puma bonus at the rate of one month a wages from 1948 up to 1952\nis no bonus was paid in 1953 a dispute arose between the company and the workmen which was referred for adjudication along with other matters\nthe Industrial Tribunal held that it had not been established that puma bonus had been paid at the uniform rate of one month a wages for a sufficiently long time and for unbroken period and therefore rejected the claim for puma bonus for 1953\nin the other question relating to whether the workmen were entitled to receive from the company any benefits for the period of service rendered by them under Messrs M a a\nIspahani Ltd it held that the workmen were entitled to take into account the service rendered by them under Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd in the matter of benefits due under the law during their service under the company\nthis award led to two appeals one by the company on the question of benefits arising from the service rendered under Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd and the other by the workmen with respect to puma bonus for the year 1953\nthe Labour Appellate Tribunal allowed both the appeals\nit held on the question of bonus that it had been proved that puma bonus had become a term of employment and the workmen were therefore entitled to bonus at the rate of one month a wages for the year 1953\nis to the benefits arising out of the service rendered by the workmen under Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd it held that there was termination of employment of the workmen when Messrs M M Ispahani migrated to Pakistan and the employment of the workmen by the company was fresh employment and they therefore were not entitled to any benefits arising out of their employment under Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd\nboth the company and workmen applied for special leave to appeal to this Court against the decision of the Appellate Tribunal insofar as it was against them\nthe applications were granted and that is how the matter has come up before us\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a be shall first take up the appeal of the company relating to put a bonus for the year 1953\ntwo points have been urged in this behalf namely a the Appellate Tribunal had no jurisdiction to interfere with the finding of the Industrial Tribunal as 959 Ispahani Ltd Calcutta a a pah in\nEmploym Umon it was a finding of fact and anchor J\na even the Appellate Tribunal had jurisdiction its decision is incorrect in law\nPuja is a special festival in Bengal and it has become usual with many firms there to give bonus before puma to their workmen\nthis matter came up before the Appellate Tribunal in Jtlahalaxmi Cotton Mills Ltd Cafoutta a Mahalaxmi Cotton Mills Worlcers Union\na in that case puma bonus was claimed as a matter of right payable by the employer at a special season of the year namely at the time of the annual Durga\nhis right was not based on the general prince Puja\npee that labour and capital should share the surplus profits available after meeting prior charges\nit was held in that case that this right rested on an agreement between the employer and the employees and that the agreement might be either express or implied\nthere the agreement was not express circumstances might lead the tribunal to an inference of implied agreement\nthe following circumstances were laid down in that case as material for inferring an implied agreement a the payment must be unbroken a it must be for a sufficiently long period and a the circumstances in which payment was made should be such as to dude that it was paid out of bounty\nthe Appellate Tribunal further pointed out that it was not possible to lay clown in tcrnrn what should be the length of period to justify the inference of implied a agreement and that that would depend upon the cir substances of each case\nit also pointed out that the fact of payment in a year of loss would he an import want factor in excluding the hypothesis that the payment was out of bounty and in coming to the conclusion that it was as a matter of obligation based a 1952 L A C 370\na a a C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of r959 Wanchoo\nIspahani Ltd Calcutta a Ispahani on implied agreement\nis to the quantum of bonus it was laid down that even if payment was not at a uniform rate throughout the period the implied agree men to pay something could be inferred and it would be for the tribunal to decide what was the reasonable amount to be paid as puma bonus\nthe tests laid down Employees Union in that case have since been followed in a number of cases by the Industrial Tribunals and the Labour Appellate Tribunal\nVe do not think it necessary to refer to all those cases\nit may now be taken as well settled that puma bonus in Bengal stands on a different footing from the profit bonus based on the Full Bench formula evolved in the M illowners Association Bombay a the Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh Bombay a\nthe claim for puma bonus in Bengal is based on either of two grounds\nit may either be a matter of implied agreement between employers and employees creating a term of employment for payment of puma bonus or secondly even though no implied agreement can be inferred it may be payable as a customary bonus\nin the present case we are concerned with the first cate gory namely that based on an implied agreement creating a term of employment between the employer and the employees and so we shall confine ourselves to that category\nit was this kind of bonus which was considered by the Appellate Tribunal in Mahalaxmi Cotton Mills case a\nbe are of opinion that the tests laid down in that case for inferring that there was an implied agreement for grant of such a bonus are correct and it is necessary that they should all be satisfied before bonus of this type can be granted\nthis brings us to the two questions raised on behalf of the company as set out above\nthe first question namely that the Appellate tribunal had no juristic ion to interfere with the finding of the Industrial Tribunal that begin a question of fact can be easily disposed of\nbe are of opinion that the decision whether there is an implied term of employment is a mixed question of fact and law and not a pure ques ion of fact\nthis is similar to the decision for example on a question whether a custom has been a i950 L L J\n1247 a 1952 L A C\n370 of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a z959 Ispahani Led Calcutta a Ispahani established or whether adverse possession has been Proved or whether a Hindu family has ceased to be joint as a matter of law accepting the facts proved\nthe Appellate Tribunal will therefore have jurisdiction to consider whether on the facts proved before the Employees Union Industrial Tribunal an inference in law can be drawn that an implied term of employment for grant of puma bonus has been established\nthe Appellate Tribunal therefore had jurisdiction to consider this matter\nanchor\nthe next question is whether in law the decision of the Appellate Tribunal drawing the inference of an implied term of employment in this case is correct\nthe undisputed facts here are these the workmen when they were in the employ ofMessIB\nM M\nIspahani Ltd always used to get puma bonus at the rate of one month a wages\nthis was asserted by the workmen in their written statement and the company did not deny it in its reply\nall that it said was that the practice or custom prevalent at the time of Messrs M M\nIspahani Ltd and the payment of bonus by that company were immaterial and did not bind the company\nthis aver men impliedly admitted that Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd used to pay puma bonus as alleged by the respond dents\nthe company practically took over the business from Messrs M M\nlspahani Ltd and it was found that it had been paying bonus ever since it came into exist hence from 1948 right up to 1952 without any break attherate of one month a wages and that this bonus was paid even in the years in which the company suffered in the circumstances it was established in this loss\ncase that a the payment was unbroken and a it was not paid out of bounty due to profits having arisen for it was paid in some years of loss also\nthe only other question that remains is whether it had been paid for a sufficiently long period in order to justify the inference that it was an implied term of employment\nthe length of the period depends on the circumstances of each case and what may be a short period not justifying an inference of an implied term of employ men in one case may be long enough in another\nin the present case sin a the appellant has paid the bonus S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of continuously since its birth we agree with the Appel late Tribunal that the circumstances justify the inference of an implied term of employment for pay men of puma bonus at the rate of one month a wages every year\nthe appeal of the company must there fore fail\nI959 a pahang Ltd Calcutta a Ispahani Employees Unio11 Wanchoo Turning now to the appeal of the workmen on the question of benefits we are of opinion that the decision of the Appellate Tribunal on this question also is correct\nit is true that the company practically took over the business of Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd\nbut as pointed out by the Appellate Tribunal when Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd transferred their head office from Calcutta to chittagong the question arose of trenching those employees who were not willing to go to Chittagong in view of the expected partition in these circumstances the company when of India\nit came into existence in September 1947 agreed to employ those employees of Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd whose services were likely to be terminated\nthese employees apparently agreed to the termination of their services with Messrs M M Ispahani Ltd and therefore obtained settlement of their claims for provident fund and also received all arrears of salary from them\nthey were thereafter appointed after withdrawal of their provident fund by the company\nthere was no express or implied undertaking given by the company regarding continuity of service and the employees joined the provident fund of the company in the circumstances the decision of the afresh\nAppellate Tribunal on this question is correct and the appeal of the workmen must also fail\nbe therefore dismiss both the appeals and in con sequence order the parties to bear their own costs of this Court\nappeals dismissed',

workman namely B N Das hereinafter called Das which had been taken up by the Assam Chah Karmchari Sangh which is a registered trade union\na reference was made by the Government of Assam on March a 1956 to the Industrial Tribunal on the question whether the dis missal of Das was justified and if not whether he was entitled to reinstatement with or without com sensation or any other relief in lieu thereof\nDas was dismissed by the company on March of 1955\nthe charge against him was that on the night of February a a 1955 he along with one Samson also an employee of the company committed theft of two wheels com plate with tyres and tubes from the company a lorry a of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a 959\nits a known Wanchoo J which amounted to gross misconduct under the Stand in

on February of but the manager suspended him for ten days from March a\nthereafter he was served with a charge sheet on March of 1955 asking him to show because why he should not be dismissed for gross misconduct as men toned above\nbe gave a reply on March of that as the case was sub juice in the criminal court the question of dismissal did not arise at that stage and the allegations against him would have to be proved in the court\nin March of the manager held an enquiry which was followed by dismissal on that very day\nbe shall mention later in detail what happened at the enquiry as that is the main point which requires consideration in this appeal\nto continue the car native however the police submitted a final report and the magistrate discharged Das on March of 1955\nthereafter his case was taken up by the union and eventually reference was made to the Tribunal on March a 1956\nthe Tribunal came to the conclusion that the dismissal of Das was not justified on the ground of proper procedure not having been followed and also for want of legal evidence\nit went on to say that normally Das would have been entitled to reinstatement but in the peculiar circumstances of this case it was of opinion that he should be granted the alternative relief for compensation\nconsequently it ordered that Das would be entitled to his pay and allowances from February of to March of 1955 and full pay and allowances from March of till the date of payment\nit also ordered that he would be entitled to fifteen day a pay for every completed year of service along with all benefits that accrued to him till the date of final payment\nthis award was given on October of 1956 and was in due course published and came into force\nwhereupon there was an application to this Court for special leave to appeal which was granted and that is how the matter has come up before us\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of two points have been urged before us on behalf of z959 a to to a a to a re una was not a compete the company namely a T a Ph la a re una under a a of the Industrial Disputes Act No\nXIV of 1947 hereinafter called the Act as it then stood and a the award of the Tribunal is not sustainable in law as it shows as if the Tribunal was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held by the company an a this it was not entitled to do\nbe\na you an a T E a a a a a a its Workmen a chop J\nreference in this case was made on March a 1956 before the amending Act No\nXXXVI of 1956 came into force\nit the relevant time therefore a a of the Act which provided the qualifications of a tribunal required that where it was one member try banal he a should be or should have been a Judge of a high Court or a should be or should have been a district judge or a should be qualified for appoint men as a Judge of a high Court\nthe contention is that Shri Hazarika who a a the tribunal in this case was not qualified under this provision\nthis content ion was not raised before the Tribunal and therefore the facts necessary to establish whether Shri Hazarika was qualified to be appointed as a tribunal or not were not gone into\nShri Hazarika was an Additional District Sessions Judge Lower Assam Division at the time the reference was made\nassuming that he was not qualified under clause a above he might well have been qualified under clause a if he had been a District Judge elsewhere before he became an Ad national District Judge in this particular division\nfurther even if he had never been a District Judge he might be qualified for appointment as Judge of a high Court\nthese matters needed investigation and were not investigated because this question was not raised before the Tribunal\nin the circumstance we are not prepared to allow the company to raise this question before us for the first time and so we reject the contention under this head\nbe\na\nthe Tribunal gave two reasons for holding that namely a that the dismissal was unjustified of SUPREME COURT ltEPORTS 1960 a\na a z959 a see Wamhoo J proper procedure had not been followed and a that Ph Iba T E a a legal evidence was wanting\nto far as the second\na a reason IS concerns to ere IS once a to a criticism on its Workmen behalf of the company that the Tribunal had proceed de as if it was sitting in appeal on the enquiry held by the company\nbut considering that the Tribunal was also of opinion that proper procedure had not been followed we have still to see whether that find in of the Tribunal justifies the conclusion at which it arrived\nbe may in this connection set out in detail what happened at the enquiry on March of as appears from the testimony of the manager and the documents produced by him before the Tri banal\nthey show that when the enquiry was held on March of certain persons whose statements had been recorded by the manager in the absence of Das during the course of what may be called invest nation by the company were present\nthe first ques ion that Das was asked on that day was whether he had anything to say in connection with the disappear once of two lorry wheels and tyres from the garage\nbe replied that he had not hing to say dating that he knew nothing about the theft\nbe was then told that the people who hall given evidence aga inst him were present a and he should ask them what they had to say\nbe replied that he would put no questions to them\nwhen the witnesses present were asked the the the evidence they had given before the manager was correct or not and if that was not correct they were at liberty to amend it\nthey all replied that the evidence they had given before the manager was correct\nthis was all that had happened at the in thereafter the order of and query of March of dismissal was passed by the manager\nthe manager a testimony shows that the wit nesses who were present at the enquiry were not examined in the presence of Das\nit also does not\nshow that copies of the state meets made by the witnesses were supplied to Das before he was asked to question them\nfurther his evidence does not show that to he statements which had been recorded were read over to Das at the enquiry before he was asked to question the witnesses\nit is S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of\ntrue that the statements which were recorded were produced on behalf of the company before the Tri Ph la T E a banal but the witnesses were not pro use so to at they might be cross examined even at that stage on behalf of Das\nthe question is whether in these circumstances it can be said that an enquiry as Wamhoo J required by principles of natural justice was made in this case\na its Workmen you are a x959 a a stat be may in this connection refer to Union of India a T R Varma a\nthat was a case relating to the dismissal of a public servant and the question was whether the enquiry held under art\n311 of the Constitution of India was in accordance with the print files of natural justice\nthis Court speaking through Venkatarama Ayyar J observed as follows in that connection at a 507 stating it broadly and without intending it to be exhaustive it may be observed that rules of nat real justice require the to a party should have the poor unity of a during all relevant evidence on which he relies that the evidence of the opponent should because taken in his presence and the to he should be given the opportunity of co a examining the witnesses exam min de by that party and that no materials should be relied on against him without his being given an opportunity of explaining them\nit will he immediately clear that these principles were not followed in the enquiry which took place on March of inasmuch as the witnesses on which the company relied were not examined in the presence of Das\nit is true that the principles laid down in that case are not meant to be exhaustive\nin another case New Prakf ash Transport Co Ltd a New S wanna Transport Co Ltd this Court held that rule of natural justice vary with the varying con situations of statutory bodies and the rules prescribed by the lewis nature under which they have to act and the ques ion whether in a particular case they have been contravened must be judged not by any preconceived de notion of what they may be but in the light of the provisions of the relevant Act\nin that case it a 1958 S C R\n499 1957 S C R\nof\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a P hubbard a\nJ state a its workmen z959 T E was held that the reading out of the contents of the police report by the Chairman at the hearing of the appeal was enough compliance with the rules of nat real justice as there was nothing in the rules requiring a copy of it to be furnished to any of the parties\nWanehoo J\nthat was however a case in which the police officer making the report was not required to be cross examined on the other hand the party concerned was informed about the material sought to be used against him and was given an opportunity to explain it\nthe narration of facts as to what happened on March of which we have given above shows that oven this was not done in this case for there is no evidence that\ncopies of the statements of witnesses who had given evidence against Das were supplied to him or even that the statements made by the witnesses to the manager were read out in extensor to Das before he was asked to question them\nin these circumstances one of the basic principles of natural justice in an enquiry of this nature was not observed and there fore the finding of the Tribunal that proper procedure had not been followed is justified and is not open to challenge\nthe defect in the conduct of the enquiry could have been cured if the company had produced the witnesses before the Tribunal and given an opportunity to Das in Messrs Basa Musa to cross examine them there\nSugar Works Private Ltd a Shobrati Khan a we had occasion to point out that even where the employer did not hold an enquiry before applying under a of of the Act for permission to dismiss an employee he could make good the defect by producing all relevant evidence which would hare been examined at the enquiry before the tribunal in which case the tribunal would consider the evidence and decide whether per mission should be granted or not\nthe same principle would apply in case of adjudication under a of of the Act and if there was defect in the enquiry by the employer he could make good that J effect by producing necessary evidence before the tribunal\nbut even that was not done in this case for all that the company did a a is\nlos\n746

S\nhills formed the export agency their mab1hty Sugar Mills Ltd to sell sugar at the controlled rate fixed by the Govern men by its notification of July of 1958 as the market was very weak and there were no purchasers of sugar the Union of India at the controlled rate even out of the releases made by and another the Government for free sales\nthe export agency Hidayatullah J reminded the L K S\nhills that the industry had agreed to finance the Export Agency Division by letting it have the sale proceeds of sugar diverted for internal sale less Rs\nof per maund as an on account pay men\nthe export agency offered to show a concession to the L K S\nhills and asked them to sell sugar in instalments of a 500 a 500 and a 565 bags with a week a interval between each\nit asked the L K S\nhills to co operate and let the export agency send documents for a 500 bags at Rs\nof of no\nper maund sex factory\nit appears that a mistake was made in putting down a 000 bags but the meaning was perfectly plain\nthe L K S\ngirls however insisted that they were unable to sell sugar at the controlled rate and that as they were in financial difficulties it was not possible to honour the documents as suggested by the export agency\nto replace the quota diverted the L K S Mills proving obdurate the export agency wrote on November a 1958 that it proposed to send documents for the full quota of a 565 bags at Rs\nof of per maund\nthe L K S\nhills were requested to retire the documents immediately as funds were needed urgently for purchase of additional quantities for export for it enquired the name of the bankers internal sale\nto whom the documents might be sent by the agency\nthe L K S\nhills it appears did not agree to any of the courses suggested and the export agency wrote on November of 1958 that the L K S\nhills were requested to remit a sum of Rs\na of 216 of no\nbeing the amount calculated at the rate of Rs\nof of no\nper maund in respect of the total sugar quota

sugar for eternal consumption would be withdrawn\nsubsequent to this too the export agency wrote to\nthe L K S Mills saying that a demand draft for the Union deg India Rs\nof 845 of no\nwas being sent to which was attached\nxcISe Hidayatullah\nofficer of the factory for releasing the first instalment of a 500 bags\nthe L K S\nhills were asked to pay the excise duty and to clear the bags from bond and to intimate to the agency that they had done so\nsimilar documents were prepared for the other instalments and forwarded through the Bank\nthe L K S\nMills how ever did not agree to this and the export agency thereafter on December of 1958 sent a telegram that unless the drafts were retired immediately the quota sugar should be kept ready for despatch so that delivery might be taken by the export agency\nthe export agency also informed the L K S\nhills that otherwise the name of the Mills would be communicate de to the Chief Director Sugar as a defaulter\nthe export agency also sent an order for delivery of the quota sugar and required the L K S\nhills to despatch it by goods train freight to pay consigned to the export agency\nit also intimated that the Mills should draw on the export agency for the amount of excise duty paid by the Mills plus on account payment at Rs\nof per maund\nsuch was made of the error in describing the quota as of D of but in view of what had already been understood it can not be suggested that the L K S\nhills were in any way misled\nthe L K S\nhills informed the export agency that their bank position did not allow them to honour the drafts nor despatch the desired quantity of sugar at the rates mentioned by the agency\nthey also stated that they were not able to despatch more than 500 bags as wagons over the eastern Railway were limited\nthe export agency however did not agree\nfinally the export agency demanded remittance of the sum of Rs\na of 216 of no\nby the with January and gave the alternative to the L K S Mills to despatch the sugar by that date according to the S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of instructions communicated earlier\nthe despatch L K S\nhills wired saying that the Banks were demand Th L a K\na in

August of 1958 was sent nothing appears to have been heard by the export agency\nin November of 1958 the export agency asked the S P B\nhills to remit to it by December of 1959 is\na of 524\nof no\nbeing the amount calculated in the same way as for the L K S\nhills\nin December of 1958 in continuation of this letter a despatch order for the entire quota was sent in the same terms as in in reply the S P B\nhills pointed out the other case\nthat they were working the Mills as short term lessees having obtained the lease from the High Court of Allahabad on payment of Rs\na of 000 as lease money and Rs\na of 000 as security on August a 1956\nthey also pointed out that they were required to purchase additional machinery stores etc for a sum of Rs\na lakhs and that a sum of Rs\na of 500 was spent in connection with the repairs to the factory and wages for the period during which the factory was re started\nthey further pointed out that they had suffered a loss of Rs\na of 000 in the last season and another loss of Rs\nof 000 on account of the strike of cane growers in March 1958 that all their sugar stock was pledged with the Punjab National Bank Bijnor against an advance of of per cent\nof the price and that there were arrears of cess amounting to about Rs\na of 000 and that the lease money amounting to is\na of 000 for the next season was also due\nthey therefore expressed their inability to send any sugar they also stated that if they redeemed the pledged sugar even after paying the on account money to the Bank of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a i a a z959 and another a the Bank would be receiving Rs\nof a a per maund less than the controlled price of sugar\nthey further Ts LoMrd Ku L honda stated that it was not possible for them to sell sugar a\nsugar at the control led once xed y to a Drrectorate an ended by saying that they were not in a position to the Union of India despatch sugar pointing out at the same time that the Act was unconstitutional and not binding on them\nthe export agency however was not agreeable and it asked the S P B\nhills either to deliver the export quota or pay the net sale proceeds for the same pointing out that the Mills ran the risk of liability for the additional excise duty of Rs of per maund\nHidayotullah and another a a\nwhile matters stood at this stage and the S P B\nhills had neither paid the amount demanded nor agreed to despatch the sugar a petition was filed in this Court and a temporary stay was obtained\nthe questions that have been raised in these pet tons are many but they can be grouped under two heads viz the virus of the legislation and the propriety of the action taken under it\nthe argument about the virus challenges the Act as a whole and also clause by clause\nin regard to the virus of the Act the pet toners draw attention to the statement of objects and reasons incorporated in one of the affidavits in the case\naccording to them the declared object of the Act is to earn foreign exchange\nthey contend that if foreign exchange is so urgently needed there should have been uniform legislation compelling other sugar manufacturers who do not manufacture by the vacuum pan process also to export sugar\nthis argument is based on alleged discrimination and on art\nof of the constitution\nthe petitioners further contend that manufacturers of commodities other than sugar are not compelled to export in a like manner and thus there is further discrimination\nin our opinion this argument is without substance\nthe power of Parliament to make laws in relation to foreign exchange is manifest\nentry to\nof of the Union List specifically confers jurisdiction on Parlia men to legislate in relation to foreign exchange\nthat entry if interpreted widely would embrace within J S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of a I959 and another a you\nand another a itself not only laws relating to the control of foreign exchange but also to its acquisition to better the a L\na economic stability of the country\nthe need for a a foreign exchange to finance the various development schemes was very properly not disputed\nit is thus plain\nthat the object of the Act is in the public interest\nthe Union of India of we are to exist as a progressive nation it is very necessary that we carve out a place for ourselves in Hidayat blah J the International market\nthe beginning has to be made and many a time it is at a great loss\nthat the Central Government has selected the sugar industry for an export programme does not mean that it can not make a classification of the commodities bearing in mind which commodity will have an easy market abroad for the purpose of earning foreign exchange\nduring the Suez crisis sugar was exported in large quantities from this country and earned of a crores as foreign exchange\nthere is nothing on the record to show that export of other commodities was not also undertaken though it was pointed out in arguments that manganese ore was also exported in a similar manner to earn foreign exchange\nit is quite obvious that the central Government can not order the export of all and sundry manufactured commodities from the country without being assured of a market in foreign countries\nnecessarily the government can only embark upon an export policy in relation to these products for which there is an easy and readily available market abroad\nfor this reason also sugar produced by the vacuum pan process may have been selected because such sugar is perhaps in demand abroad and not sugar produced by any other process\nit must be realised that goods manufactured in our country have to stand heavy competition from goods produced abroad and even this export can only be made at great sacrifice and is made only to earn foreign exchange which would not otherwise be available\nin this view of the matter it can not be said that there is discrimination in so far as sugar manufacturers by the vacuum pan process are concerned\nGovern men is the best judge as to which commodities are of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a z959\nTheLordKrishna Sugar Mills Ltd what most likely to earn foreign exchange and the selection thus made is justifiable as a reasonable classification it name y to a a is re rated tot a of sect of to a of a A a a a a a and another a earning of foreign exchange\nand another Hidayatullah\nthe next contention is under arts\nof a of and a the Union of India and also of of the constitution\nthe petitioners contend that the whole export programme in respect of sugar amounts to an infringement of their fund mental rights under arts\nof a of and a and amounts also to a compulsory acquisition of their pro party without payment of compensation\nthe pet toners analyse the scheme of the Act and state that it amounts to taking sugar from owners for sale abroad at such price as it may fetch the owners being paid when such money is received after deducting the expenses of the export agency and the cost of export\nthey state that the owners stand to lose because admittedly sugar is going to be exported at a loss and the loss is to fall on the owners of factories\nthey further state that if the necessity for foreign exchange was felt the loss entailed in the earning of foreign exchange should be borne by Government or be distr busted among all industries or at least among all the sugar producers in the country\nit is urged that the Act is an unreasonable restriction upon the fund mental rights to hold acquire and dispose of pro party and to carry on occupation trade or business\nin reply the learned Attorney General on behalf of the Union as well as the Directorate of Sugar refers to the negotiations which took place between the Government and the sugar industry and the arrange meets which were made to save owners of factories from the loss which is inevitable as a result of this export programme\nbe were taken through the various Control Orders which were passed by Govern men under the Essential Commodities Act about this time fixing the\nprice of sugar for internal consume ion\nin particular reference is made to the Sugar Control Order 1955 Notification No\nG S R 661 ESS\nCom Sugar dated July of 1958\nit is pointed out that by that Notification the price of sugar was increased by of no\nper maund on all internal sales\na a C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of a\nz959 and another to enable the factories giving their export quota to recoup themselves for the loss which might be entail the Lord krishna de\nit was anticipated that the loss would be recouped sugar Mills Ltd if there was an increase of of no\nper maund in the price of sugar for internal consumption and the export quota was fixed at i per cent\nof the total the Union of India production of a factory for 1957 of\nthe loss it was and Anoth expected would be more than set off by the excess Hidayatullah J price which the producers would be able to get for every of mounds sold for internal consumption\nit is also pointed out that Government at that time did not wish to take over the work of export on itself and specified as the export agency the indian Sugar Mills Association a body composed of of per cent\nof the sugar mills in the country\nthe learned Attorney General also points out that more than of per cent\nof the mills have stood by this arrangement and did either supply their quota of sugar or sold it in the internal market and made available the money for purchase of sugar for export\nonly a few mills in the country resorted to these devices to get out of the commitment which the industry as a whole had entered into\nthe learned Attorney General also contends that the petitioners had obtained favourable prices for sale of sugar in the country but were not willing to honour their other commitments which after the agreement of the sugar industry were given legislative form\nlearned counsel for the petitioners contends that the virus of the Act should be considered without reference to other circumstances such as the agree meets price adjustments and price control as they have no bearing upon the reasonableness of the lewis in State of Madras a V G Row a this Court nation\nlaid down that in judging the reasonableness of a restriction upon fundamental rights the surrounding circumstances can be looked into\nPatanjali Sastri C J observed as follows it is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness wherever prescribed should be applied to each individual statute impugned a 1952J a a R\n597 607\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a\n959 and another a and another Hidayatullah J and no abstract standard or general pattern of reason baldness can be laid down as applicable to all cases\nTh L us a to a the nature of the right alleged to have been infringe de the underlying purpose of the restrictions i am posed the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be the Union of India remedied thereby the disproportion of the imposition the prevailing conditions at the time should all enter into the judicial verdict\nin evaluating such elusive factors and forming their own conception of what is reasonable in all the circumstances of a given case it is inevitable that the social philosophy and the scale of values of the judges participating in the dec sion should play an important part and the limit to their interference with legislative judgment in such cases can only be dictated by their sense of respond ability and self restraint and the sobering reflection that the Constitution is meant not only for people of their way of thinking but for all and that the major it of the elected representatives of the people have in authorising the imposition of the restrictions con ordered them to be reasonable\nin Virendra a the State of Punjab a S R Das C J again reaffirmed this approach\nSee also Aruna cha la Nadar a State of Madras\nit is however contended that though one can look at the surrounding circumstances it is not open to the Court to examine other laws on the subject unless those laws be incorporated by reference\nin our opinion this i a a fallacious argument\nthe Court in judging the reasonableness of a law will necessarily see not only the surrounding circumstances but all contemporaneous legislation passed as part of a single scheme\nthe reasonableness of the restriction and not of the law has to be found out and if restriction is under one law but countervailing advantages are created by another law passed as part of the same legislative plan the Court should not refuse to take that other law into account\nthe existence of such other law is not difficult to establish\nthe courts can take judicial notice of it\nis was laid down by the Privy Council in Attorney General a 1958 S C R\n308

YOU a a India the effect of the legislation will be\nclearly the acts passed by the Provincial Legislature may be consider Hidayatullah J red for it is often impossible to determine the effect of the Act under examination without taking into account any other Act operating or intended to over ate or recently operating in the province\nto doubt this was laid down in a case falling within is\nof and of of the british North America Act but the general proposition is equally applicable where the effect of the legislation on those governed by it has to in the same connection their word be measured\nships looked into the historical background of legit i nation to find out the materials which were con indeed before the legislation was promoted in the legislature\nSee also Ladore a Bennett a\nthis Court also in Arunacluila Nadar a State of Madras a examined the historical background and discovered the object of the Act from the circumstances under which it was passed\nthat other contemporaneous legislation passed as part of a legislative plan can be exit mined was clearly laid down by the Privy Council in Pillai a Muda in that case the question was whether awake\nthe Ceylon Citizenship Act of of 1948 and the Ceylon Parliamentary Elections Amendment Act of of 1949 were valid or were ultra virus the Ceylon Parliament being void under a of a of the Ceylon Constitution and Independence Order in Council 1946 as amended\nunder the first two acts the indian Tamils were denied as a community the right of franchise unless they came within the terms of the first Act\nthey were thus subjected to dis abilities and restrictions which were prohibited by a 1939 A C us 130\na 1939 A C 468 477\na a 959 S C J\n297 299 301\na 1953 A C 514\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a and another a a of a of the Order in Council\nduring the course of 959 arguments their Lordships attention was drawn to a Th L a K\na a\na later Act entitled the indian and Pakistani Residents Citizenship Act a of 1949 under which the Indian Tamils and others were entitled to get themselves the Union deg\nIndia registered a a the citizens of Cey Ion on proof of sufficient connection with Ceylon\nit was argued by anti another Hidayati blah a Mr Pritt Q C before the Privy Council that the later Act could not be read to justify the earlier Act because if the impugned Citizenship Act were bad when it was passed it could not be brought back to light by the enactment of the subsequent Act\ntheir lordships did not accept this argument and read the later Act with the previous\nthey observed it was argued that sections a and a of the Citizenship Act made it impossible that the descent wants however remote of a person who was unable to attain citizenship himself\ncould ever be able to attain citizenship in Ceylon no matter how long they resided there but their Lordships attention was subsequently drawn to the indian and Pakistani Residents Citizen ship Act No\na of 1949 by which an indian Ta mil could by an application obtain citizenship by registry ion and thus protect his descendants provided he had a certain residential qualification\nit was suggested on behalf of though appellant that this Act might itself be ultra virus as conferring a privilege upon indian Tamils within a of a a of the Constitution Order in Council and that i therefore it was inadmissible to rebut the inference that the legislature had intended by the Citizenship and Franchise Acts to make indian Tamils liable to dis in cities within the meaning of a of a a but their lordships can not accept this argument\nof there was a legislative plan the plan must be looked at as a whole and when so looked at it is evident in their Lordships opinion that the legislature did not intend to prevent indian Ta mils from attaining citizenship provided that they were sufficiently connected with the island\nit is not necessary to speculate as to the remedies of if the Sugar Control Order or the the sugar dealers notification were varied or abrogated in future\nthe S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of reasonableness of the restriction is to be judged today and in the context of the circumstances now existing\nthe Lord Krishna it can not but be accepted that the Government sugar Mills Ltd z959 a\ni a and another and another to a total a per cent\nof a a\nthough the the Union deg Ind of a\nto recoup the sugar made adequate arrangements industry for the loss which it might suffer in giving the export quota\nfor that purpose export quota was be at quantity produced by a factory the loss which was Hidayatullah J expected to be Rs\nof per maund was spread over the remaining sugar to be sold in the country and was recouped at of no\nper maund\nbe are unable to accept the plea that the petitioners were not able to sell sugar at the controlled price because the price was fixed too high\nlearned counsel for the petitioners contend that by fixing a ceiling there is no guarantee that the commodity will be sold at the ceiling price and not at a lower rate\nit is a well known propose ion that when commodities are controlled by fixation of price the commodities sell only at the controlled price and not less\neconomists have complained that the worst fault of price control is that the price does not fall below the controlled rate\nthere is nothing in the record of the case to show that the Mills were not able to sell their sugar at the controlled price\nbe are satisfied that the object of the Act does not infringe the fundamental rights of the petitioners\nto prevent any loss to the petitioners countervailing additional prices were allowed on sales of sugar for internal consumption\nthe petitioners did not stand to lose ultimately\nthe quota was fixed at a\nper cent\nof their total production and it is inconceivable that they are unable to sell sugar in the open home market\nthis suggestion of the petitioners that they are unable to sell sugar at the controlled price has not been substantiated by the production of a single document to show what they held in stock and what they had sold\nthe balance sheet produced by the S P B\nhills shows that they were able to sell more than a lakh of bags in eight months as against the quantity of a 079 bags for export\nit is obvious that the plea that the hills are unable to sell sugar at the controlled price is a mere sham\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a r959 and another indeed an examination of the correspondence in the first case clearly demonstrates that the Mills were the Lord K rising devising one excuse or another to a void the liability Sugar Ii fills Ltd first they raised the to supply the quota of sugar\nandAnother contention that they did not have the requisite grade\na the Union of lydia when they raised the contention that they could not sell sugar\nthereafter they asked for supply in instal Hidayatullah J meets and when instalments were fixed they put forth the excuse of there being no wagons available\nthey next urged that the Bank was charging interest and that interest should be waived before the doc meets would be retired\nwhen interest was waived in these the petition in this CouJ it\nthey filed circumstances in our opinion there can be no ground for holding that there has been an infringement of the fund mental rights of the petitioners\nthe restriction was not unreasonable because arrangement was made to save the owners of the factories from loss and the loss entailed by the export of sugar was to be borne by the consumers in India and not by the producers\nthere is our more circumstance which may be considered\nthe foreign export served the national interest by stabilising the sugar market so that the production of sugarcane nay be maintained at a re enable level\nit also stabilised national economy by earning foreign exchange\nthe loss if any was comparatively small and was spread over many factories\npart from the very real possibility of its being recouped by sales in the country the loss itself was so small as not to amount to an unreasonable restriction\nthe petitioners next challenge the Act in its parts to show that there is infringement of fundamental rights or in the alternative compulsory acquisition of their property without compensation\nin this connect ion is\na to a are challenged\nsection a only permits the central Government to fix the quota leviable from different factories\nof the object and purpose of the Act is valid and also is in the public interest there being no disadvantage to the owners ultimately a a which fixes the quota for export from sugar produced sep a tell\nby a factory can not be challenged S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of of z959 andAnother andAnother a section a makes it incumbent on the owner to supply that\nsugar on demand and further provides that after Th L a K\ndeli very of sugar the owner retains no rig to exc it of us a a of receive payment therefor under a a\nthis section is criticised on the ground that delivery of goods and pay end of the price should be concurrent conditions the Union of India that is to say that the buyer should be ready and willing to pay the price in exchange for possession of Hidayatullah a the goods\nof the Government a a buying sugar the provisions of a of of the indian Sale of Goods Act which is apparently relied upon here might have been invoked\nthe object and purpose of the Act is to export sugar and to divide the receipts less expenses among the owners who supply sugar for export\nthe argument overlooks the scheme that export is made by a Central Agency for the industry as a whole and the prices obtained abroad are payable and they are less than those at which sugar of various grades sells within the country\nthe section does not suffer from any infirmity if the object and purpose of the Act is as has been found above valid and constitutional\nit must not be forgotten that during the time payment was due the owners were getting an additional of no\non every maund sold by them in the country\nreferred payment is not deprivation of property nor an in encroachment upon fundamental rights\nthe affidavits show that the entire quota of of 000 tons has been exported that it has earned Rs\na a crores in\nforeign exchange and that the exporters have been paid except for a small balance\nsection a is the penalty section\nbe heard cons durable argument as to whether the section would apply to a case where no delivery was at all made in view of the words where sugar delivered by any owner falls short of the export quota\nto action has yet been taken against the Mills under the section nor has any penalty been imposed\nthe question whether the section is ultra virus the legible sure need not be considered here\nsection a deals with export of sugar or its sale by the owner or the export agency\nit is stated that the of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a z959 and another a another\na Hidayatullah a sell sugar in his custody\nsection deals with sugar delivered to the export agency T1 LordKrishna and here there as no sugar delivered\nthe first tide Sugar Mills Ltd section deals with export and the export agency can only export sugar delivered to it\nthe second sub\nsection authorises the export agency to sell the sugar Th Umon deg\nInd a for reasons given in the first sub section\nit also authorises the export agency to permit the owner to in the present cases there was a demand for delivery of the sugar of the quota and that has not been met\nwhether the petitioners have exposed themselves to any penalty can only be considered when penalty is actually imposed on them\nthe condition that the sale proceeds are payable to the export agency is perfectly valid regard being had to the scheme of the export and the advantage allowed on all sales in India\nthe owners having obtained that advantage can not claim to keep the proceeds of such sales by which the export policy is to be run\nbut of the of 000 tons about half was sold in India and with the sale proceeds other sugar was bought and exported and this would not be possible if the export agency were required to make a spot cash payment\nsection a provides how payments to owners are to be made\nsince the export was by a non profit making agency composed of the sugar industry it is obvious that the payments could not be made forthwith\nis explained already the owners received payment after the sale prices were received from abroad\nnecessary deductions of expenses have to be made and the proceeds are then distributed\nto doubt such payment is likely to be somewhat delayed but looking to the small quantity involved i a\nnot more than of per cent\nunder the Act and in actuality only i per cent\nit was not likely to make it very hard for the owners who were in the meantime breaking this loss at the rate of of no\nfor every maund of sugar sold in India\nin our opinion none of the sections considered here even viewed separately is ultra virus\nthe petitioners did not challenge the action taken by the export agency as being contrary to the Act\nto argument can be considered in view of the want of a plea to this effect in the two petitions\nin the petition S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of r959 by the S P B\nhills the petitioner did not invite any decision on the correctness of the demand for the the Lord Krishna additional excise duty because no such duty has in Sugar Mills Ltd fact been demanded\nthe main contention of the\nhills was that all sugar was pledged with banks\nthe pleadings on this part of the case are far from clear or the Union of India a J Th fri us event\na on a re terence is to a a or a IC a is insufficient\nhowever in view of the fact that learned counsel reserved this point to be raised for exemption from payment of additional duty we say nothing about it\nand another\nand another a to a a Sarkar\nthe result is that both the petitions fail and are dismissed with costs\nSARKAR J a think these two applications should succeed\nthey raise the question whether the Sugar Export Promotion Act 1958 is invalid as imposing an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners right to carry on their trade\nhome of the petitioners are owners of factories manufacturing sugar by a process called the vacuum pan process and they carry on business as manual tuners of and dealers in sugar\nfor the purposes of this judgment these persons may be taken to be the petitioners\nthe principal respondent in these applied tons is the Government of India\nthe other respond dent is the indian Sugar Mills Association an associate ion of manufacturers of sugar by the vacuum pan process\nin June of 1958 the Government had promulgated an ordinance\nthe impugned Act was passed on September of 1958 repealing the ordinance and re enacting its provisions and also providing that anything done under the Ordinance would be deemed to have been done under the Act as if it had come into force when the Ordinance had been promulgated\nis appears from its preamble the Act was intended to provide for the export of sugar in public interest and it set up a machinery for that purpose\na will summarise here the main provisions of the Act\nSec ion a empowers the central Government to specify a company or other body corporate as the export agency to perform the functions of that agency under the Act\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a r959 and Anotha\na and another Sa car a\nthe respondent indian Sugar Mills Association was the Lord Kdsh a specified as the export agency

Umon of India exceed twenty per cent\nof the quantity of sugar produced in India unto the month of October in that year\nsection a also provides that\nin fixing such quantity the central Government shall have regard to a the quantity of sugar available in India a the the quantity of sugar which in its opinion would be reasonably required for consumption in India a the necessity for exporting sugar with a view to earning foreign exchange in the public interest\nsection a requires the central Government to apportion the quantity fixed under a a among the owners of factories producing sugar by the vacuum pan process in pro portion to the quantity produced or likely to be produced by them respectively during the season\nthe quantity so apportioned to each factory is called its export quot to section a provides that every owner of a factory shall on demand by the export agency deliver to it sugar unto its export quota and on delivery the owner shall retain no rights in respect of such sugar except his right to receive payment therefor under section a\nsection a makes provision for an additional excise duty being levied in certain circus stances on the quantity of sugar by which the sugar delivered by the owner of a factory falls short of its export quota\nsection a states that the export agency shall export the sugar delivered to it provided that in certain circumstances specified the export agency may sell that sugar in India and may if it thinks fit our chase other sugar for export and for this purpose permit the owner to sell the whole or part of its export quota at a price approved on condition to hat the sale proceeds are paid to it\nthe provisions of a a are important and will be set out later\nit is not necessary to refer to the other provisions of the Act\nsoon after the Ordinance had been promulgated the Government started taking action under it\nby a notification dated June of 1958 of 000 tons of sugar S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of a a 959 parker\nit is said by Thr Uuion deg\nIndia and another and tier was fixed under a a as the total quantity for export for the period ending October of 1958\nexport quotas the Lord rish11a were duly fixed for all factories including those of the sugar Mills Ltd petitioners\nthe petitioners were thereafter asked by the export agency to sell the sugar and pay the sale proceeds to it\nthis they failed to do\nthe respondents that the petitioners were also asked to deliver the sugar and this also they failed to do\nthe petitioners set up various reasons justifying their failure to sell or deliver the requisite quantities of sugar\nit is unnecessary to refer to there reasons for if the Act is invalid as the petitioners contend the orders could not be made and no question would arise as to whether the petitioners had valid reasons for not carrying them out\nit appears that to lee export agency felt that the petitioners were neither going to sell the sugar and pay the sale proceeds nor to deliver the sugar and it there upon pointed out to the petitioners that they were by their conduct exposing themselves to the risk of having to pay the additional excise duty under a a\nit was then that the present application for appropriate writs restraining the respondents from taking steps under the Act were launched by the petitioners on the ground inter asia that the Act was invalid as it unreasonably restricted the petitioner right to carry on their trade\na now proceed to examine the validity of this contention\nfrom the provisions of the Act earlier set out it is quite clear that it requires the owner of a sugar factory to part with a portion of the produce of his factory in exchange for an amount to he fixed under the prove signs of a a\nthe Act therefore restricts his freedom of trade it takes away his right to trade with the whole of his merchandise in any manner he likes\nthe question is is such restriction reasonable\nit is necessary now to set out the terms of a a of the Act which fixes the amount which a manufacturer of sugar in entitled to receive in respect of the sugar delivered by him\nonly sub is\na and a of this sec ion need be set out and they are as follows section a a the export agency shall at such time as it thinks fit make to the owners who have a of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a 959 delivered sugar to it under this Act payments deter T L do\na mined in accordance with the provisions hereinafter in\na IS section contact\nSugar Mills Ltd is Ha the or\nand Anothtr\na a from the total sale proceeds in respect of the\nquantity fixed for export under section a for any year the a no it\nthere shall be deducted the total expenditure incurred by the export agency a respect of the sugar whether by way of administrative expenses or otherwise and the balance shall be apportioned among the owners in proportion to the quantity of sugar delivered by then respectively during that year\nSarkar J\nthe substance of the matter then is that an owner of a sugar factory gets in exchange for the sugar deli verde by him under the Act a proportionate share of the sale proceeds less the expenses\nbe has no hand in deciding at what price the goods would he sold by the export agency\nof they are sold for a very low a ice he has no right to complain\neither has he any power to control the expenses\nthe exchange value that a sugar manufacturer is entitled to get under the Act for sugar delivered by him therefore depends entirely on the export agency\nAgain under sub sec\na of a a the export agency need pay the many facture only at such times as it thinks fit\nit may he difficult to say that all these terms are reasonable\nhowever that may be there is another aspect of the question which in my view decides it\nit is quite plain that as things are sugar can be sold abroad only at a loss\nthat clearly appears from the materials on the record and is not indeed disputed\na think it enough to refer to the Objocts and Reasons of the Act and to a statement in the affidavit of Shri K P Jain Chief Director Directorate of Sugar affirmed on February of 1959 and filed on behalf of the Government to show that the Act contemplated that the export of sugar made under it would result in a loss\nin the Objects Reasons of the Act it is stated with a view to earning foreign exchange it is necessary to promote export of sugar\nthe export of sugar however involves a loss even if excise duty and cane cess are remitted\nS C ARE SUPREME COURT REPORTS of in paragraph of of Shri Jain a said affidavit it is z959\nT iieLordKf she sugar Mills Ltd and another a the Union of India and another Sakrar J stated a of a a the art or Ray to at a in ire so me envisage in the Act depends on the pooling of the losses on export by all sugar factories in India in proportion to their export quota\nto a\nbe then get to this that on the respondents own case the exports under the Act can he made only at a loss\nthe result therefore is that the Act compels the a petitioners to part with a portion of their merchandise at a loss\nan the restrictions so put on the petitioners trade by the Act then be said to be reasonable\na conceive it is impossible to do so\nit is said that the Act was passed with a view to earn foreign exchange by export of sugar\nindeed so it appears from the Objects Reasons of the Act earlier set out and the a will agree that provisions of a a earlier quoted\nearning of foreign exchange is essential for the country\nbut a do not see that that justifies the enactment of a legislation which imposes a loss on a sugar manual turner\nit is not as if foreign exchange could not be earned without inflicting loss on the manufacturers of sugar\nthat indeed is not the respondents case\nthe loss might have been avoided if for example the exports were made by the grant of a subsidy a course in fact adopted by the Government in the year 1951 of\nit has not been said that there was any difficulty in granting the subsidy for the exports under the Act\na reasonable restriction on a citizen a right to carry on his trade which alone is permitted by art\nof a of the Constitution must be as Mahajan J said in Chintaman Rao a the State of Jl Jadhya Pradesh a a restriction which reason dictates which under a it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed in article of a a and the social control permitted by clause a of article of must be held to be wanting in that quality\nhere a do not find the balance struck nor the infliction of the loss a course which reason dictates\nthe loss which the restrictions imposed by the Act on the petitioners trade caused to them was by no means such as could only have been avoided by incurring a greater loss\na 1950 S C R\n759 763\nof SUPREME COURT REPOH TS 1960 a 959 and another a a also think it clear that an object however laudable can not by itself and without more make a restriction the Lord Krishna S gar Mills Ltd put on a citizen a right to carry on a trade for attain in that object reasonable\na restriction on a per son a right to carry on his trade does not become the Unio11 of Indio reasonable simply because it had been imposed on him to achieve an object of great necessity and in\ndoubted merit\nthe reasonable SS has to be judged in 111 the circumstances of the case and the object to be attained is only one of such circumstances\nthis in my view is too clear to require elaboration\nand another parker\nit is not necessary for me to pursue the matter further for it is not the respondents contention that the a estrictio11s are reasonable notwithstanding that they anne loss\nin the other hand the contention of the respondents is for reasons to be presently stated that the Act really caused no loss and that being so the restrictions imposed by it can not he said to be in re enable\na proceed now to consider to he respondents re son for saying that the Act imposes 110 loss on the sugar manufacturers including the petitioners\nit is fit st a did that though the exports result in a loss now it may in future bring in profits\nthat hope is dearly only a pious hope\nAud what is more it is not a hope which has even been expressed in the affidavits filed\non behalf of the respondents\nin the contrary these affidavits make it perfectly plain that in the foreseeable future there is no hope of export of indeed it is said in sugar being made at a profit\nthese affidavits that the scheme of the Act is based on the pooling of the losses caused by the exports made under it\nit is hardly necessary to point out that if the exports con al be expected to of produce a profit in in the near future the nocrcivc machinery of the Act for making the exports would he unnecessary\nthere is no in is whatever for saying that in some years the export may result in a profit\nindeed on the respond dents own affidavits it is not open to them to say that they hope that it may be possible in future to make a profit oil export of sugar\nwhen it is said that the export quota\nfixed for 1957 of is only a\nper cent\nof the production of each S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of I9 S9 and another a and another Sarkar J factory\nthe point sought to be made is that there fore the amount of the loss would be very small\nnow the Lord Krishna al per cent\nof the production of the factory of the Sugar Mills Ltd petitioners in Writ Petiti a in to\na of 1959 is of 533 mounds\nit is stated by to he respondents in the sup elementary affidavit of Shri Jain affirmed on March of the Union of India 1959 that on the export the loss will be in the region of Rs\nof per maund\nin this basis the loss to the petitioners in that petition would be Rs\na of 530\nthe loss to the petitioners in Writ Petition No\nof of 1959 would be slightly\nless\na for myself would hesitate to say that losses in such amounts are negligible\nthe export quota for 1958 of has been fixed at a Jer cent\nof the production\nnaturally the loss would be much larger\nthe Government have the right under the Act to increase the quota unto of per cent\nthe loss if the quota i increased to the utmost would be for in the cases of factories with larger product middle\nion the losses would be much larger than the pet toners losses\nand of course the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the Act has to be tested generally and without reference to any particular sugar the manufacturer\nproposition that the reasonableness of a restriction depends on the quantum of the loss it produces\neven a small loss may conceivably make a restriction caus in it unreasonable\nthe quantum of the loss can not by itself decide the reasonableness of the restriction\nDoes reason dictate that a small loss shall be inflicted\nnothing that has been said in this case leads me to hold that\na am also unable to agree to it is then said that the loss caused by the Act was recouped by an order made by the Government in creasing the home price of the sugar and therefore in fact the manufacturers suffered no loss\nthe process of recoupment was thus stated in paragraph of of the said main affidavit of Shri Jain the incidence of loss on the first quota of of 000 tons fixed by the Government was assessed and when the Central Government fixed the price of sugar for internal consumption under the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act and the Sugar Control of of UPREME OORT HEPOHTS i law a I959 order 1955 they gave adjustment in price by adding of no\nper nrnuud in the sex factory prices of sugar for the Lord Krishna internal a files\nSugar J a Jills Ltd and Anoth a it is said that the increase so made in the home price of sugar would completely wipe out the loss incurred the Union of in i a on the export under the Act of a per cent of the produce of a factory\na will accept this as a correct a will also ignore the petitioners contention estimate\nthat they had not been able to well the sugar in the home a take at to he incr used price\nS1irkar J and Anothu the argument then is that though the impugned Act produces a loss that loss can he ignored because the Government has taken steps under another Aut to recoup the loss so occasioned\nit is said that in the circumstances that prevail namely the increase in the homo price the restrictions imposed by the impugned it can not he said to be unreasonable for on the whole they occasion no loss\nthis is indeed the principal contention of the respondents to establish a fit to lie restrictions are not unreasonable\nnow a reference to the Essential Commodities Act under which to he home price was increased a to be made Jt\na passed in Hie year 1955\nit was not indeed it had intended to ont n foreign exchange nothing to do with foreign exchange or with helping the sugar industry\nsection a of this Act provides section a\na of the central Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices it may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production supply

under this order that the Government issued a notification on July of 1958 enhancing the home price of sugar by of no\nper maund which it is said wipes out the loss caused by the impugned Act\na will assume that the Notification increasing the price was issued with the object of recouping the loss caused by the impugned Act as stated in the affidavit of Shri Jain though the Notification itself does not say so\nthe question then is is the increase in the home price of sugar made by the Government by a Notification issued under the powers given to it by another Act which has the effect of wiping out the loss inflicted by the impugned Act a circumstance which makes the restrictions imposed by the latter Act reasonable\nit is said that this is so that in judging the reason baldness of the restriction imposed by one Act it is permissible to consider an order made by the executive Government under another Act\nbe were referred to the observations of Patanjali Sastri C J in State of Madras a V G Rao a\nthe learned Chief Justice there stated at a 607 the nature of the right alleged to have been infringed the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed the extent and urgency of

judicial approval as a general pattern of reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights\na do not at all set that the respondents can derive any support for their present contention from anything that Patanjali Sastri C J said\na entirely agree that in deciding the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by a statute all the prevail in conditions and all the circumstances of the case S C

permissible\nthat is not a reasonable the Union of India test\nit is not reasonable to say that the validity of a statute would depend on something which the execute i have Government may do or undo at any time\nthe statute imposing the restrictions does not give any right that the Government would do something to make the restrictions reasonable\nnow can such a re striction be reasonable\nnow can an Act which is prime face unreasonable and it is on that basis that the present argument arises be held to be reasonable because of something to which it gives no right and the existence of which depends entirely on the choice of the executive government\nis it to be said that the restrictions imposed by a statute are reasonable because the Government has when the question crop ped up done something which makes the restrictions reasonable though it was not bound to do that and though it is free to undo that which it has done\nto say that would be to say that the Act is valid because the Government has for the time being chosen to make it so\nthis seems to me to be against all known principles of law\nfurthermore if the respondents contention was right a statute would then be legal when the Govern men chooses to do a thing and illegal when it undoes it and so on from time to time at the choice of the Government\nthat would be intolerable in any legal system\nit was said that this is unavoidable and may happen in many cases\nthe following illustration was given\nSuppose in famine conditions a statute was passed controlling free sale of foodstuff\nassume that the prevailing conditions made the restrictions put on free sale reasonable\nwater\nnormal conditions returned which made the control of sales of foodstuff annexes say and therefore unreasonable\nthe Act would

time made the Act of be valid and again invalid as to which a do not feel a led upon to say anything now that does not justify the adoption of a rule which would make the validity of an Act depend on the choice of the Government\nof fluctuating validity is the result in one case it does not follow that the same consequence would occur in another and a totally different case\nparker\nthe Government to increase Again the validity of the Notification enhancing the a home price seems to me to admit of grave doubt\nfind nothing in the Essential Commodities Act nor naturally in the Sugar Control Order 1955 which would authorise the price simply for the sake of recouping to the many fractures the loss caused to them by the impugned Act\na have earlier set out the relevant provisions of the Essential Commodities Act\nthe power to fix the prior of sugar given thereby can be exercised for maintaining or increasing the supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices\nthat power can not therefore be exercised for recouping loss caused to a manufacturer by another Act the object of which is to earn foreign exchange\nof it is said that the Notifica ion was issued for the purposes mentioned in the Essential Commodities Act it becomes at once apparent that the price fixed under it has no relation to the impugned Act and may have to be altered irrespective of the latter Act\na find it impossible to say that a Notification fixing the price of sugar on different condo in deciding the tons can be reasonableness of the impugned Act which is entirely unconnected with these considerations\ntaken into account for all these reasons a am unable to agree that the Notification increasing the home price can be taken S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of\na to\na use res notions of because loss of into consideration in deciding the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned Act\nit follows the Lord Kmr a St

said that the indian sugar Mills Associa ion of which the petitioners al a Raid to be members wanted that arrangements for export\nof sugar abroad be made and it was for that reason that the impugned Act was passed\nit was suggested that the Association agreed to the Act being passed\nit is therefore contend de that the restrictions imposed by the Act must be presumed to be reasonable and the petitioners can not be heard to say that they are not\nnow the request by or the agreement of the Association is of course not the request by or the agreement the petitioners\nthe Association has no authority to bind the pet toners by any request or agreement\nthe fact that the petitioners were members of the Association if that were so does not give the Association the authority\nthere is no evidence that the petitioners had assented to the Association making the request or the agreement\na\nor all that is known the petitioners may have been again to the As location making any request to the Government to take steps for export or agreeing to the passing of the Act\ntherefore it seems to me that the petitioners rights are not affected by anything which the Associctt ion might have done\na think it right also to say that there is no material on the record whatever to ltd to the conclusion that the Association had agreed to the Act being passed in the form in which it stands\nand of course it is only the it is true that the Act with which we arc concerned\nAssociation had suggested that the Government should take steps for export of sugar\nthat would a para are from the minutes of various meetings annexed to the affidavits used on behalf of the Government\nbut there is nothing in these minutes nor anywhere else in the records which would indicate turn the Association wanted that sugar should be exported though that might put the manufacturers to a loss\nthe position in the year 1951 of the appears to have been this\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a 959 sugar manufacturers were placed in a difficult position the Lo a Krishna because of competition from khandsari and gur sugar Mills Lid manufacturers who could buy sugar cane for their and another manufactures at a low price in the open market while the sugar manufacturers were compelled to buy cane at the Union deg\nIndia prices fixed by the Government which were high\nto some of them as appears from Annexure A to Shri Jain a said affidavit made the following suggest tons to the Government in March 1952 to give them relief and another Sarkar J a a the price of cane be reduced to be\na per maund\na the sugar manufactured from the lower priced cane be frozen and kept as a national Reserve for Export or for such other purposes as the Government may consider desirable\na to reduce the accumulation of stocks in the factories and to make room for further storage and to liquidate the stocks into cash serious efforts be made either from Government to Government or through trade channels to export out at least a lakh tons alter naively the State Governments be asked to take delivery of the quantities from the factories and store them in their own godowns\na of there is any profit in the export of such quantities the same may be utilised either for giving a\nbonus to the cane growers or in lowering the price of sugar for home consumption\nit is clear from the suggestions thus made by the manufacturers that they wanted the burden on them to be relieved and export at Government a cost\nin that year the Government in fact permitted an export of of 000 tons and gave a subsidy of Rs\na per maund to cover the loss on the export\nwater in the same year though Government reduced the price at which the sugar manufacturers could purchase the cane\nin the years 1952 of to 1955 of India imported large quantities of sugar and did not export sugar at all\nit also appears that during these years the consumer ion of sugar in India was much more than the production\nHence obviously the need for the import\nto clearly in these years the sugar manufacturers did not need to S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of x959 export their sugar\nthe respondents do not say that during these years the sugar a manufacturers had asked Tlie Lord Krishna for arrangements for export berg made\n1956 of was S1t a Mills Ltd the year of the Suez crisis\nin this year a substantial quantity was exported and large profits could be made\nbecause price of sugar in some of the markets abroad though Umon deg India\na a a suez so a a crisis because a gone up be to ion\nthe proposition then is that between 1952 of and 1956 of the industry was doing very well and had no need to ask for Government a intercession to enable it to export\nand another Sarkar J and another\na a a the the to a a there is no evidence that in 1957 of there was\nany over production\nthe figures for this year in tons are production of of 000 consumption of of 000 and export of 000 the figure for export being that fixed under the Act\nit appears however that various representatives of the Government and the sugar manufacturers met and decided upon the idea of export in sugar for earning foreign exchange in Government a interest and getting a foothold in the world market in the int rests of the manufacturers\nit was realised that the export would result in a loss but the many fractures agreed to export provided they were allowed to make up the loss from the internal market\nfor this purpose the suggestion made as appears from annette D to the affidavit of Shri Jain was as follows the internal market will be Jen free as at present\nhowever to provide an element of stability to the market releases for internal sale shall be regulated by Government of India in active consultation with the industry\nto what the trade had agreed to was that they would be prepared to export sugar provided they were left free to recoup from the internal sales the loss caused by the export\nthis is very different from agreeing to the Act which made no provision for recouping the loss from the internal sales\nthe sugar manufacturers did not approve of the Act being con tent to depend on the Government a sense of fair play to relieve the hardship caused by it\nof SUPltEME COURT REPORTS 1960 a a a by to and 1no1hu would the to the there remains one other contention to deal with\n959 Th Lord Krishna it a a rest 1011s are reason a a site to by is say M of Lid\ni a of a result in stabilising the sugar industry\npart from a saying that the Act would stabilise the sugar industry the Union of India the affidavits used on behalf of the respondents do not show how that would be done or that there was any need for it\nfrom what a have earlier stated it does not appear to me that the industry needed any stab ligation\nthe figures given earlier show that product ion has always been less than internal consumption excepting for the year 1951 of\nbut it appears from one of the annexurcs to the affidavit of Shri Jain that even then the difficulty was only temporary\nit is there stated Sarkar\nagain in 1952 of it was decided to export unto a lakh tons\nbut only about of 000 tons could be exported as in the meantime there was an appreciable rise in the sugar prices and the surplus stock was consumed in the home a take\nthe Y of of of in tons the estimated figures for appear to be as follows production of of 000 con sumption of of 000 export a of 000\nit would thus appear that the sugar industry in India has always been stable and did not require any export to make it stable\nthat a think however puts the matter beyond thou by is a a of the Act\nunder that section in fixing the total quantity of war to be exported in any season regard is to be had only to the quantity avail able in India the quantity required for consumption in India and the necessity of earning foreign exchange\na of in deciding the quantity to be exported no question of stabilising the industry or prices arises\nagain it is not out of the excess of the production over the internal consumption alone that the exports are to be in fact there has never really been any excess made\nof production over consumption requirements\nindeed it is plain that if sufficient sugar were left to meet the home consumption then the\nincreased price would not help the industry to recoup the loss\nof supplies were adequate to meet the demand the price can not be forced up\nS O R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of a therefore come to the conclusion that the Act 959 a which makes the petitioners suffer a loss on the

separate judgment is my inability to persuade myself to agree with one of the reasons given by Hiday tullah J for his conclusion\ninvolves a principle of far reaching that reason importance namely whether in ascertaining the reasonableness of restrictions imposed by a statute on a fundamental right it is permissible to rely upon a notification issued by Government in exercise of power conferred on it by another Act unconnected with the impugned one\nbefore a embark upon the merits of the case it would be convenient at the outset to clear the ground by expressing my view on the said question\nthe facts of the case have been fully stated by my learned brother in his judgment and a need not restate them except to notice a few relevant and material facts\nthe Essential Commodities Act 1955 Act of of 1955 was enacted for the purpose mentioned in the preamble to that Act\nin exercise of the powers conferred by a a of the said Act the central Government issued an order dated

1958 the Central Govern men promulgated an ordinance called the Sugar Export Promotion Ordinance and it was subsequently converted into an Act of of 1958 which received the assent of the President on September of 1958\nit is said that the central Government in fixing the price for sugar produced during the season 1957 of in vacuum pan sugar factories situate in the areas specs find in the order had taken into account the possible loss the exporters might incur by reason of the applied ion of the provisions of the impugned Act\nShri K P Jain Chief Director in the Directorate of Sugar

Act are reasonable within the meaning of art\nof of the constitution\nin support of this contention he relied upon the decision of this Qourt in State of Madras a V G Row a\nthat decision was concerned with the question whether a of a a of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act 1908 of of 1908 as amended by the indian Criminal Law Amend men Madras Act 1950 was unconstitutional and void\nit

discussing the said question Patanjali Sastri C J observed at a 607 it is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness wherever prescribed should be applied to each

representatives of the people have in authors in the imposition of the restrictions considered them to be reasonable\nof a may say so with respect this passage summarizes the law on the subject folly and precisely\nthat is reasonable in a particular set up may be unreasonable in a society with a different background\nthe learned Counsel relying upon the words prevailing conditions and the subsequent words in all the circumstances of a given case contai1rnd in the above observation of Patanjali Sastri C J contended that the said words were comprehensive enough to take in notifications issued by the Government and therefore the said order of the central Government fixing the rate would be one of the elements to be taken into consideration in testing the reasmmbleness of the impugn a Act\na find it difficult to accept this augment\nthe learned Attorney General has not been title to place before us any decision which end to the length of holding that such notifications could enter the judicial verdict\nit is true that the prevailing conditions at the time the Act was nude should be taken into consist ration for the effectiveness of a restriction imposed for a part wuhu purpose depends upon the said conditions\nin a society addicted to opium the legislature has to make a law imposing severe restrictions on the right to in a society where a particular come the same\nvice in rampant any restriction imposed to eradicate that Yi a has to be moulded in accordance with the needs of the time\nduring times of stress and strain such as war or pestilence greater restrictions may

in my view was not stating any thing more than the obvious for the standard of reasonableness is inextricably conditioned by the state of society and the urgency for eradicating the evil sought\nto be remedied\nbut a am clear in my mind that the validity of an Act shall not be made to depend upon another Act unconnected with the impugned Act or power conferred thereunder which might if properly exercised off set the evil tendency or the vice of the impugned Act\nof the validity of an Act is made to depend upon such a foundation a super structure will have been built on shifting sands\nto do that is to destroy the stability of legislation and to introduce an uncertain element therein\nof two or more acts were parts of the same scheme or plan to implement the same or common objective or if the impugned Act though it was not originally conceived at the time when the earlier Act was passed was only an extension or a further step by legislature for implementing the object of the earlier Act or if the legislature by express reference incorporated in the impugned Act the provisions of the earlier Act it would be permissible to rely upon the said provisions of the earlier Act not because they formed part of the prevailing conditions but because either the earlier Act formed part of the impugned Act by reference or both of them formed part of the same legislative plan\nthe illustrations are not exhaustive but they all fall under one or other of the following two categories i an earlier Act is made part of a new Act and ii both acts are parts of a legislative scheme or plan where both of them were conceived at the inception but passed in stages or conceived at different times on the basis of experience gained but passed in furtherance the test of of the same scheme\nin such cases of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a and another 959 Subba Rao a find in the and another a reasonableness in regard to one Act may be made to depend upon the impact of the other on it\nbut to go a beyond this is to destroy to a stability of legislation and to produce an uncertain element\nto go further and to depend upon a notification of a transitory the Union of India nature issued under an unconnected Act is to place the statute in a fluid state\nin such a situation its validity would depend\nupon a statutory order of temporary duration it would change colour with the changing attitudes of an authority empowered to issue the order\nit would also mean that a Court will have to embark upon a roving search of all acts and notifications which may by design or accident alleviate or mollify the evil consequences of an impugned Act\nsuch a result can not be contemplated\nthe learned Attorney General has not placed before us any decision in support of his broad proposition but a judgment of my learned brother Hidayatullah J a few decisions which it is said go to the full length of supporting the argument of the learned Attorney General\na have carefully perused the said decisions and a do not find anything said or implied therein to support the said contention\nthe in Attorney General for Alberta v Attorney decision General for Ca ada a was concerned with a conflict between the jurisdictions of the Dominion and Provin dial Legislatures under is\nof and of of the british North America Act 1867 the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Alberta passed an Act respecting the taxation of banks and imposed thereunder on every corporation or joint stock company other than the Bank of Canada incorporated for the purpose of doing banking or savings bank business in the Province an annual tax in addition to any tax payable under any other Act\ndefaulters of payment of tax were to be visited with penalties and the payment of either tax or penalty could be enforced by distress and sale of goods and chattels or by action for civil debt\nit was contended before the Privy Council that the proposed taxation was not in its true sense taxation in order to the raising a 1939 A C II7\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of r959 and another Subba Rao\nof a revenue for provincial purposes so as to be within the exclusive legislative competence of the

called into exist a once and given the necessary powers there to conduct the Union of India their business by the only proper authority the Parliament of the Dominion under a of of the british North

Committee compared the relative legislative lists took judicial notice of other acts and the object and purpose of the Act in question\nhaving regard to the said consideration it came to the conclusion that it was a honourable legislation aimed at to prevent the operation within the province of the aforesaid banking institutions\nwhen a statute is attacked on the ground that it is a honourable legislation i a it assumed a form apparently falling within the legislative compete once of the legislature but in effect and substance intended to reach institutions beyond its legislative competence it is obvious that all the surrounding circumstances including other acts operating in the Province have to be scrutinized to unravel the fraud on power\nthis decision in my view can not be invoked to serve the present purpose\nfor does the decision of the Judicial Committee in Lad ore a Bennett a carry the matter further\nthe question in that case was whether the Provincial legislation in question did not encroach upon the exclusive lewis native power of the Dominion Parliament in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency interest or or in ate rights outside the province\nfor

the basis of that notification\nto put it in other words though the impugned Aet docs not confer any power or impose a duty on the Uoveriiment to off set tote loss by fixing the rates of sugar having

the same from the defaulting owners of sugar\nthe scheme of the Act therefore is a self contained one\nthe object is to provide for the export of sugar in the interest of public and that object is sought to be achieved by fixing the quota of sugar for export and distributing the same among the owners of factories subject to the condition that in no case it should exceed twenty per cent\nof the quantity of sugar produced in India in a particular season\nthe quantity is also fixed it out detriment to the requirements for internal consume ion\nthe apportionment of the quota among the various

an over all of of SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a 959 and Anoth are and Anoth of a control presumably to see that no injustice is done to the parties concerned\nthe short question is whether the Th Lord Krishna said restrictions on the freedom of the petitioners to Sngar Milts Ltd acquire hold and dispose of property and carry on trade or business are reasonable within the meaning of Th Unfon of India clauses a and a of art\nof of the constitution\nthe restrictions must have a reasonable relation to the object which the legislature seeks to achieve and must bubba Rao of not go in excess of that object\nthat is the object of the legislature\nthe object of the legislature is to provide for the export of sugar in public interest\nit can not be and indeed it is not denied that at the time the Act was passed there was a sincere and serious national effort to industrialize our country with the avowed object of raising the economic standards of our people\none of\nthe necessary conditions for industrializing our country is to start heavy industries and that can not be done unless the country earn foreign exchange to enable it to import plants for starting the same\nit is also self evident that it would be in the interests of sugar industry to build up a foreign market for that commodity\nthe object of the Act was therefore demorrntrably to serve the national interest and the scheme evolved certainly had relation to the object sought to he achieved for all the pro visions of the Act were conceived in to genuine attempt to induce foreign export in sugar by co operative effort\nof so the only objection to to he restrictions imposed can be on the basis that the for edom was a abridged or curtailed unduly or arhitmrily\nbut for the Act the petitioners could have Kold their sugar in the open market without exceeding the rank fix a under the Essential Commodities Act a J in\nthe correspondence filed in the case marked 1tn11exures A H and C clearly demonstrates that both the industry i a well as the state were equally interested to stimulate foreign trade and build up a foreign market\nunder the scheme embodied in the Act three restrictions are imposed on the owners of factories i they must contribute to the stock for export\nnot exceeding twenty per cent\nof the quantity produced in their factories ii they are paid only their proportionate S C R\nSUPREME

are unreasonable or excessive\nthe three restrictions the Union of India are really the props of the scheme\nof there was no statutory compulsion on the owners of factories to a\na sugar pro use a supp a a reason a action of their factories the export agency would not get the requisite quantity of sugar for export\nof there was no provision imposing a penal cess on defaulters there would be no sanction to compel them to deliver their quota of sugar\nthough the final payment was deferred till the nett sale proceeds were realised they would be paid the price for the sugar supplied at the rates fetched in the foreign market\nit is common case that at present the export trade in sugar ends in loss but it can not be predicated that it will be a chronic feature and there will not come a time\nwhen the export trade in sugar will earn profits\nit may be that a better scheme mill to have been evolved by the legislature or it might be more beneficial from the standpoint of owners of factories if to he State purchase de the exportable quantity for ready cash and exported the same on its own account\nbut it is not for this Court to evaluate the comparative merits of different schemes so long it is satisfied that the scheme act ally evolved stands the test of reasonable\nthe correspondence between the State and the industry shows that the industry as a whole co operated with the State in evolving the scheme which culminated in the passing of the Act\nthe State as well as the industry are equally interested to stimulate foreign trade and build up foreign market\nto capture foreign market or to have a substantive share therein is not an easy task as it depends upon many imponderables namely the availability of sugar its demand its comparative ID edit a with the sugar produced in other markets transport facilities mutual agreement request meets loss must have to be borne to get a foothold and the clear international affiliations etc\ninitial of SUPREME COURT

the learned Attorney General did not pursue that line in his argument and a have therefore considered the ques ion only from the st endpoint of the compelling need of the State to earn foreign exchange and the long range aim of the industry to build up a foreign market\na therefore hold that the restrictions imposed by the statute on the fundamental rights of the petitioners are not arbitrary and are reasonable within the mean in of art\nof of the constitution\na agree with my learned brother Hidayatullah J in the on the other questions raised in this case\nresult the petitions

the customs officials he was taking out of India across any customs frontier as defined by the central Government the cur ency notes in question\nit was also urged that explant ion offered by the appellant was accepted by the trying Magistrate and the High Court ought not to have set aside the acquittal of the appellant there being no good ground why his explanation should not have been accepted\nthe version of the appellant as to how the sum of Rs\nof 000 in currency notes was with him was that he was not searched at all at the customs barrier\nbe had taken out the currency notes in question from his trouser pocket and handed over the same to the Cus toms Officers stating the circumstances under which he was carrying the same on his person and asked for a receipt\nthe Customs Officers instead of giving him a receipt falsely charged him with smuggling the currency notes out of India without any permit\naccording to the appellant he had applied to the Reserve Bank of India at Calcutta for a permit and had sent an a policy ion for that purpose to one Joshi in Calcutta\nbe failed to receive the permit unto the last moment\nis intention was to hand over the money to the Cus toms Officers for safe custody\nin other words the appellant a version in substance was that as he had failed to get the permit unto the last moment he vol unitarily handed over the currency notes in question to the customs officers at the customs barrier for safe keeping\nbe had at no time any intention to carry out of India the said currency notes without a permit\nthis version of the appellant was accepted by the try in Magistrate who acquitted him\nthe High Court however did not accept his version\nit was urged that the appeal is before us on a certified ate and as the High Conrt had come to a different a 959 Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas a the Stale of West Bengal Imam\nof SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a finding on a question of fact to what the trying Magi state had found it was open to the appellant to urge that he was entitled to question the findings of the High Court\nit is true that the High Court has taken a different view to that taken by the trying Magistrate and has rejected the appellant a case that he had vol unitarily handed over the currency notes in question to the customs Officers in the circumstances mentioned by him and that he had no intention to take that money out of India without a permit\nnonetheless the finding of the High Court is on a question of fact\nbe can see no particular reason in this case to go be hind the findings of fact arrived at by the High Court\nthe high Court gave very good reasons for accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the circumstances in which the currency notes in question were recovered from the appellant when his person was searched\nin important circumstance which might have supported the appellant a case namely whether he had applied to the Reserve Bank of India for a per it to take out of India currency notes to the extent of Rs\nof 000 was considered by the High Court\nit found on the evidence of the Superintendent of the Reserve Bank that the Reserve Bank received no application from the appellant before September a 1952 nor had the Reserve Bank granted the permission to the appellant to take any currency notes out of India\nit was on September of that the Reserve Bank had received an application of the appellant forwarded by one G C\njosh by his letter dated September of 1952\nthe the date September a 1952\nthe High Court thought that there were grounds for suspecting that this apply action was antedated\nthe high Court came to the conclusion that there was no evidence to show that any such application was write or submitted on Sep member a 1952\nit does seem extraordinary that if the appellant had sent the application to Joshi on September a 1952 that Joshi should not have sent on that application to the Reserve Bank till September of 1952\nit is to be remembered that the incident had already taken place on September a 1952 and in that application of the appellant bore r959 Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas a the State of West Bengal Imam\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS of connection on September of and of 1952 Inspector Mitra of the special Police Establishment Calcutta had applied for a search warrant and a warrant i if a rest respectively against the appellant\nin arrest under the terms of that warrant he was released on bail by the police with a direction to appear before the court on September of\nthe appellant had therefore ample opportunity to concoct an application for a permit after September a and to antedate it getting Joshi on Sep member of 1952 to forward the same to the Reserve Bank\nit is inconceivable that a person who was leave in for Hong Kong and wished to carry such a large sum of money as Rs\nof 000 in currency notes would have applied on September a when he was actually to fly on September a 1952\nfurther it would not be unreasonable to suppose that the appellant would have so timed his arrival at Calcutta as would have enabled him to make the necessary enquiries from Joshi or the Reserve Bank whether the permit asked for had been granted\nit is impossible to believe that he had arrived at Calcutta and had gone direct to the Dum Dum Aero rome without making any enquiry from Joshi at least whether the permit asked for had been granted\nform a fly one would expect the appellant to reach Calcutta\nin sufficient time to make the necessary enquiries and in the absence of a permit having been granted to have left the currency notes for safe custody with Joshi or some other trusted person\nit is an entirely accept able story which the appellant put forward that he waited unto the last moment at the aerodrome for the necessary permit and not having got it requested the customs Officers to keep the currency notes for safe custody\nit is significant that the appellant did not examine Joshi as a witness in support of his case\nit is not us likely that if he had done so some inconvenient results would have followed in consequence of close questioning of Joshi regarding the entire transaction\nbe have therefore no reason to think that the High Court had erred in suspecting that the application to the Reserve Bank was antedated\nin this finding it is apparent that the very foundation of the defence of the appellant is false\nthat the appellant did not hand I959 a\narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas a the State of West Bengal Imam 100 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a over

is no reason to distrust his testimony\nreference has been made to some of the evidence on a question of fact in order to satisfy ourselves whether the finding of the High Court was correct\nbe are satisfied that the finding of the High Court is the only view which could reasonably be taken in a case like this\nit is true that the appellant had not taken the currency notes in question out of India across any customs frontier as defined by the central Government\nbe had however clearly attempted to take the same out of India\nin such a case no question of his crossing the customs frontier arises\nthat an attempt to take out the currency notes in question is an offence punishable under the Sea Customs Act is clear from the provisions of a 167 item a\nthe Foreign Exchange Regulation

the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act or any rule direction or order made thereunder\nfurthermore this point was not taken before the Bench which granted the certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court\nbe that as it may tie facts found clearly established that the appellant attempted to take out of India the currency notes in question\nbe had entered the customs enclosure and had signed the declaration form\nbe had been questioned as to whether he had any other article than those mentioned in the declaration form which he wished to declare and he had answered in the negative\nin his personal search he dropped his trousers on the ground\nbe was asked to pick up his trousers and wear them again\nin search of the trousers Rs\nof 000 I959 Narayandas Bhagwandas

formalities all that was left for him to do was to board the plane which would take him 011t of India\nthese circumstances establish beyond all reasonable doubt that the act of the appellant had gone beyond the stage of preparation and was clearly an attempt to carry the sum of Rs\nof 000 in currency notes out of India without a permit from the Reserve Bank\nbe can not accept the argument made on his behalf that the act of the appellant on the fact found amounted merely to preparation of and not an attempt\nthe main submission on behalf of the appellant was directed towards establishing that the entire proceed rings before the Additional District Magistrate and the trying Magistrate were without jurisdiction as cognize once of the offence had been taken on September of 1952 in contravention of the provisions of a of a of the foreign Exchange Regulation Act there being on that date no complaint in writing made by an officer authorised in that behalf by the central Government or the Reserve Bank of India by a general or a special order\nit is therefore necessary to see in the circus stances of the present case on what date cognizance of the offence was taken\nin order to ascertain this certain provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure will require con federation\nunder a of a of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act a District Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class may on a representation in writing a are by a person authorized in this behalf by the central Government or the Reserve Bank and having reasons to believe that there had been contravention of any of the provisions of that Act issue a search warrant\nInspector Mitra was so authorized by the Reserve Bank to September of 1952 and in pursuance of that authorization applied to the Additional District Magistrate for the issue of a search warrant\nunder I959 Narayandas Bllagwandas Madhavdas a the State of West Bengal Imam\n102 SUPREME COURT REPORTS

police station may exercise in a cognize able case a cent that he has not the power to arrest without a warrant\nit was necessary therefore for Inspector Mitra to obtain from the Additional District Magistrate a warrant of arrest\nit is clear therefore that unto September of 1952 the Additional District Magistrate had not taken cognizance of any offence\nin September of 1952 the appellant appeared before the Additional District Magistrate who recorded the following order be is to give bail of Rs\nof 000 with ten sureties of Rs\na 000 each\nSeen Police report\ntime allowed till with November 1952 for completing investigation\nin November of 1952 on perusal of the police report the Magistrate allowed further time for investing ion until January a 1953 and on that date time was

with March 1952 for evidence\nit is clear from these orders that on September of 1952 the Additional District Magistrate had not taken cognizance of the offence because he had allowed the police time till November of 1952 for completing the investigation\nby his subsequent orders time for investigation was further extended until February a 1953\nin that date the complaint was filed and the order of the Additional District Magistrate clearly indicated that he took cognizance of the offence and sent the case for trial to Mr Sinha\nit would also appear from the order of Mr Sinha that if the Ad national District Magistrate did not take cognizance he certainly cid because he considered whether the bail should be reduced and fixed the with and with of March for evidence\nit was however argued that when Mitra applied for a search warrant on Septem be of 1952 the Additional District Magistrate had recorded an order thereon permitted\nIssue search warrant\nit was on this date that the Additional District Magistrate took cognizance of the offence\nbe can not agree with this submission because the petition of Inspector Mitra clearly states that is this is non cognize be offence a

to say that the Additional District Magistrate was not being asked to take cognizance of the offence\nbe was merely requested to grant permission to the police officer to investigate a non cognizable offence\nthe petition requesting the Additional District\nMagi state to issue a warrant of arrest and his order directing the issue of such a warrant can not also be regarded as orders which indicate that the Additional District Magistrate thereby took cognizance of the offence\nit was clearly stated in the petition that for the purposes of investigation his presence was necessary\nthe step taken by Inspector Mitra was merely a step in the investigation of the case\nbe had not himself the power to make an arrest having regard to the prove signs of a 155 a of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nin order to facilitate his investigation it was necessary for him to arrest the appellant and that he could not do without a warrant of arrest from the Additional District Magistrate\nis already stated the order of the Additional District Magistrate of September of 1952 makes it quite clear that he was still regarding the matter as one under investigation\nit could not be said with any good reason that the Additional District Magistrate had either on September of or at any sub sequent date unto February a 1953 applied his mind to the case with a view to issuing a process against the appellant\nthe appellant had appeared before the Magistrate on February a 1953 and the question of issuing summons to him did not arise\nthe Additional District Magistrate however must be regarded as having taken cognizance on this date because he sent the case to Mr Sinha for trial\nthere was no legal bar to the Additional District Magistrate taking cognize once of the offence on February a 1953 as on that date Inspector Mitra a complaint was one which he was authorized to make by the Reserve Bank under a of a a of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act\nit is thus clear to us that on a proper reading of the various orders made by the Additional District Magi state no cognizance of the offence was taken until February a 1953\nthe argument that he took cognize once of the offence on September of 1952 is without I959 Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas a the State of West Bengal Imam\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 105 foundation\nthe orders passed by the Additional District Magistrate on September of 1952 Se member of 1952 November of 1952 and January a 1953 were orders passed while the investigation by the police into a non cognizable offence was in progress\nof at the end of the investigation no complaint had been filed against the appellant the police could have under the provisions of a 169 of the Code released him on his executing a bond with or without sureties to appear if and when so required before the Additional District Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police report and to try the accused or commit him for trial\nthe Magistrate would not be required to pass any further\norders in the matter\nof on the other hand after completing the investing action a complaint was filed as in this case it would be the duty of the Additional District Magistrate then to enquire whether the complaint had been filed with the requisite authority of the Reserve Bank as required by a of a a of the foreign Exchange Regulation Act\nit is only at this stage that the Additional District Magis rate would be called upon to make up his mind whether he would take cognizance of the offence\nof the complaint was filed with the authority of the Reserve Bank as aforesaid there would be no legal bar to the Magistrate taking cognizance\nin the other hand if there was no proper authorization to file the complaint as required by a of the Magistrate concerned would be prohibited from taking cognizance\nin the present case as the requisite authority had been granted by the Reserve Bank on January of 1953 to file a complaint the complaint filed on February a was one which complied with the provisions of a of of the foreign Exchange Regulation Act and the Additional District Magistrate could take cognizance of the offence

purpose of proceeding in a particular way as indicated in the subsequent prove signs of this chapter proceeding under section 200 and thereafter sending it for inquiry and report under section

section 156 a or issuing a search warrant for the purpose of\nthe investigation he can not be said to have taken cognizance of the offence\nit is however argued that in Chari a case this Court was dealing with a matter which came under the Prevention of Corruption Act\nit seems to us how ever that that makes no difference\nit is the print siple which was enunciated by Das Gupta J which was approved\nis to when cognizance is taken of an offence will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and it is impossible to attempt to define Issuing of a what is meant by taking

workmen about bonus which was referred by the Government of West Bengal by its order of December of 195 J to the Second dust rial Tribunal\nthough the order of reference did not specify the year for which the bonus was in dispute it is common ground between the parties that the dispute was for bonus for the year 1953\nthe case of the workmen who a re respondents before us was that the company a a been paying one month a bonus invariably from 1940 to 1950\nin 1951 one month a bonus was paid in October and half a month a further bonus was paid in December\nin 1952 one month a bonus was paid\nthe demand that the workmen made in their letter of August of 1953 was for three month a bonus\nthe company replied that payments in past years had been entirely sex gratis and as there was loss in 1953 it was not possible to make any sex gratis payment that year\nthe workmen then contended in their letter of Septem be of 1953 that the sole object of bonus which had been granted unto that year was to meet puma expenses and that the payment of this bonus had become customary and a term of employment\nthe matter could not be settled between the parties and that is how the dispute was referred for adjudication\nthe company a case was that payment of bonus had all along been sex gratis depending upon profits except in a few years\nbut in those years it was also made clear that the payment was sex gratis and without creating any precedent for future\ntherefore there was neither a term of employment nor any custom I9S9 the Graham Trading Co India Ltdi a its Workmen Wanchoo\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 109 which put any\nobligation on the company to pay any bonus in a year of loss\nthe quest ion was considered by the Industrial Tribunal from three aspects\nfirstly it considered whether any bonus was payable for this year as profit bonus on the basis of the Full Bench formula evolved in the Mill Owners Association Bombay a the Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh Bombay a and it came to the conclusion that there was no available surplus of profit to justify such bonus\nit then con\nordered the remaining two aspects namely whether puma bonus could be awarded either as an implied term of employment according to the decision in M ahalakshmi Cotton Mills Ltd Calcutta a M ahalakshmi Cotton Mills Workers Union a or on the basis of custom\nit seems to have mixed up the discussion on these aspects and having come to the conclusion that puma bonus could not be awarded in this case on the basis of an implied term of employment it proceeded to dismiss the claim on the basis of custom also\nthe workmen then went up in appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal which allowed the appeal\nthe decision of the Appellate Tribunal has also mixed the two aspects of puma bonus namely whether it is based on an implied term of employment or on custom but it came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to establish custom and therefore ordered payment of one month a basic wages as puma bonus\nit was also inclined to the view that the company a accounts showing loss were not reliable and there might even be a case for profit bonus but eventually it granted one month a basic wages as customary puma bonus\nwhereupon the company filed an application for special leave to appeal to this Court which was allowed and that is how the matter has come up before us\nPuja is a special festival of particular importance in Bengal and it has become usual with many firms there to pay their employees bonus to meet special puma expenses\ndisputes have arisen with respect to this bonus which were adjudicated non by various tribunals\nis a 1950 L L J\n1247\na 1952 L A C 370\nI959 the Graham Trading Co India U4\na its Workmen Wanehoo\n110 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a for back as 1949 in a dispute bette the Bengdl Chamber of Commerce Calcutta and its employees the Industrial Tribunal which adjudicated upon the dispute observed that Durga Puja was a national festival in Bengal and it was customary to make presents to near and dear ones and to relatives at that time\nis it was difficult for poorly paid employees to make savings out of the monthly income for this purpose it therefore had become traditional and customary in Bengal for employers to make a monetary grant at the time of the pumas\nthe Bengal Chamber of Commerce had not been slow in appreciating this and had been granting bonus equivalent to one month a pay and the tribunal had been assured that there was no intention to discontinue it\nwater the matter was considered in Mahalaxmi Cottan Mills case where certain tests were laid down which would justify the inference that there was an implied term of employ men for payment of bonus at the time of the annual Durga Puja\nthat case however was concerned with puma bonus as an implied term of employment and not as a matter of tradition or custom in Bengal\nit is however clear that puma bonus which is usually paid in Bengal is of two kinds namely a where it is paid as an implied term of employment as explained in M ahalaxmi Cottan Mills case and a where it is paid as a customary and traditional payment as stated in the Industrial Tribunal a award referred to above\nbe have considered the tests to be applied where it is a case of payment on an implied term of employment in Messrs Ispahani Ltd a Ispahani Employees Union and we need not repeat what we have said there\nin the present case it has been pointed out by the company that payments which had been made in the past years from 1940 to 1952 could not be con ordered as based on an implied term 0PS employment in the circumstances of this case\nthis contention in our opinion is correct\nin implied term of employ men can not be inferred in this case for right from a Publication of

C ARE SUPREME COUR of REPORTS 111 lspahani Ltd a 1948 to 1952 the company whenever it paid this bonus made it clear that it was an sex gratis payment and would not constitute any precedent for future years\nin the face of such notice year by year it would not be possible to imply a term of employment on the basis of an implied agreement for agreement postulates a meeting of minds regarding the subject matter of an agreement and here one party was always making it clear that the payment was sex gratis and that it would not form a precedent for future years\nin dealing with the question of an implied term of the condition of service it would be difficult to ignore the statement expressly made by the employer while making the payment from year to year\nthe question however whether the payment in this case was customary and traditional still remains to be considered\nin dealing with puma bonus based on an implied term of employment it was pointed out by us in Messrs lspahani Employees Union a that a term may be implied even though the payment may not have been at a uniform rate throughout and the Industrial Tribunal would be justified in deciding what should be the quantum of payment in a particular year taking into account the varying payments made in pro virus years\nbut when the question of customary and traditional bonus arises for adjudication the considerations may be somewhat different\nin such a case the Tribunal will have to consider i whether the payment has been over an unbroken series of years ii whether it has been for a sufficiently long period though the length of the period might depend on the circumstances of each case even so the period may normally have to be longer to justify an inference of traditional and customary puma\nbonus than may be the case with puma bonus based on an implied term of employment iii the circumstance that the payment depended upon the earning of profits would have to be excluded and therefore it must be shown that payment was made in years of loss\nin dealing with the question of custom the fact that the payment was called sex gratis by the employer when it a 1960 a S C R\nof z959 Th Graham Trading Co India Ltd a its Workmen wan hoo\n112 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a was made would however make no difference in this regard because the proof of custom depends upon the effect of the relevant factors enumerated by us and it would not be materially affected by unilateral declare\ntons of one party when the said declarations are inconsistent with the course of conduct adopted by it and in the payment must have been at a uniform the rate throughout to justify an inference that payment at such and such rate had become customary and traditional in the particular concern\nit will be seen that these tests are in substance more stringent than the tests applied for proof of puma bonus as an implied term of employment\nget us now see whether these tests are satisfied in the present case\nthe practice in the present case began in 1940 and was unbroken unto 1950\nin between there was an adjudication in 1948 to which the company was a party\nit that time it was said on behalf of the company before the industrial tribunal that some bonus was being paid and that there was no intention to discontinue it and cons gently the tribunal did not adjudicate upon the matter which shows that the company recognised the traditional and customary nature of the payment and it assured the tribunal that there was no intention then to discontinue the payment\nthe payment was continued from 1949 to 1951\nin 1952 there was some dispute and originally the company paid one month a wages as advance of pay and not as bonus\nhome of the workmen however accepted the payment while others did not because they were not satisfied with the amount being paid as advance of pay\nthe chairman of the board of directors of the company visited Calcutta in 1952 and then on the representation of the workmen the advance was converted into one month a bonus and even those workmen who had not accepted the advance were allowed to draw the bonus\nit can not therefore be said that there was any break in the payment of bonus from 1940 to 1952 for if the chairman had not converted what was advance of pay into bonus in December 1952 the workmen might a\nbe raised the dispute even in the to year a and then I959 the Graham Trading Co India Ltd a its Workmen a achoo\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 113 there would have been no break up to 1951\nto there has been unbroken payment and the period has been sufficiently long to justify an inference of customary and traditional bonus\nit was pointed out that in four years during this period the payment was made in November and December and not about the time of the pumas and therefore it could not be said that this was traditional and customary puma bonus\nthe delay in payment is not in our opinion material in this case for one of the directors of the company who appeared as a witness stated as to this one month a bonus that it was paid by the company to help its staff during pumas\nthe condition that the payment should have been made in years of loss also to exclude the hypothesis that it was paid only because profits had been made the evidence is that has also been satisfied for payments were made in at least two years of loss\nlastly the condition that payment should have been at a uniform rate has also been satisfied because one month a basic wage is the quantum of bonus from 1940 right up to 1952 without any change\nit is true that in December 1951 further bonus for half a month was paid but that year was a year of profit in which cloth bonus for half a month was specially paid\nthus the rate so far as the puma bonus is concerned has always remained uniform at one month a basic wage\nit is true that the workmen pitched their demand too high for three month a bonus in 1953\nbut that does not in our opinion detract from the inference to be drawn from the facts proved in this case\nall the conditions therefore of a customary and traditional bonus are satisfied in this case and there is no reason to interfere with the order of the Appellate Tribunal though we should like to make it clear that we do not agree with the observations of the Appellate Tribunal in connection with the profit bonus

issued requiring every person whole total in come during the previous year exceeded the maximum amount which was not chargeable to income tax to furnish within such period not being less than sixty days as might be specified in the notice a return of his income in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner\nthis notice was published on or about Mav a a J45\nthe assessed dick not

calling upon the assessed to submit his return\nthis notice was served on the assessed on March a 1950 and in answer thereto the assessed submitted a similar return on March of 1950 showing the same income and adding the same foot note\nthe Income tax Officer then issued and served upon the assessed notices under is\nof a and of a of the Act asking him to produce his books of account and to tender any evidence he cared to lead\nit appears from the record that these notices were comply de with but on February of 1951 the Income tax Officer included the sum of Rs\nof 026 in the total in come of the assessed and assessed him on it for the assessment year 1945 of\nthe assessed appealed in turn to the Appdlate Assistant Commissioner and the Income tax Appt late Tribunal\nis contentions were three viz that the amount of Rs\nof 026 could not and should not have been included in his income that the amended a of of the Act had no retrospective effect and that the assessment completed on February of 1951 was in valid inasmuch as it was completed four years after the end of the relevant assessment year\nboth the Appellate Assistant Commissioner as well as the Tri banal rejected his contentions but the Tribunal on being moved by him raised and referred two questions of law under a of a of the Act to the High Court of Judicature Bombay for its decision\nthese questions were a Whether the notice issued under Section of of the Act by the Income tax Officer on of a 1950 S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 117 after the assessed had filed a voluntary return was valid in law\na Wh a

on the\nRanchhoddas same day Chagla C J and Tcndolkar J answered a arsondas Bombay both the questions in the negative\nbefore the High slide\nnah J Conrt it was again contended by the assessed that since he had submitted a return under a of a of the Act on January a 1950 the assessment if any had to be completed before March of a\nof as required by a of a of the Act\nbe also contended that he was entitled under a of a to make to voluntary return on the date he did and with a voluntary return before the Income tax Officer there was no scope for the issuance of a notice under a of\nthe High Court up held the contentions of the as\nessex and gave its opinion that the Department ought to have issued a notice under a of a within the assessment year and if no return was made within the time fixed by the notice the Department should have proceeded under a of a to a best judgment assessment\nthe other alternative for the Department was to issue a notice under a of of the Act if the period for sending a notice under a of a had expired\nbut it could not issue a notice under a of after a return was already made before it and the benefit of the extended period of limitation for assessment available under the first proviso to sub a a of a of of one year from the service of the notice under sch a a of that section was not available in this case\nthe high Court granted a certificate of fitness and hence this appeal\nthe arguments which were urged before the high Court were all raised in this Court by the parties\nthe case of the Department was supplemented by a argument that inasmuch as the assessed had suppress de his income or given incorrect particulars thereof the period during which action under a of could be taken was the extended one of a years\nin the arguments before us our attention was drawn to a cleavage of opinion between the Bombay High all SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a a to\na II a a to a a 959\na of Ht vatu of income tax Bombav v Ranchhoddas Court on the one land and the Calcutta High Court on the other\nwhile the Bombay High Court seems to be Thr Commimnner of the view that\na voluntary return showing a non II a re urn for a purposes taxa a moore is st a goo under the Act the Calcutta High Court is of the view that what is\nof a of the Act requires is a return of Karsnndas may taxable income and not a return of income which shows a loss of of below the taxable limit\nit appears\nof a our a so enter to a at one to one to a a meta trained the view that such a return was no return at all but it was explained later that this me int that the return was ineffective for the purposes of a of a of tow Act though it might he IL return being in the prescribed form\nthe Bombay High Court also enter gains the view that the ass sent proceedings com hence with the issue of public notice and that a of of the Act can not apply where in answer to the public notice a return is made whether of taxable income or not\nthe view of the Calcutta High Court is that assessment proceedings commence either with a notice under a of a of the Art or with the filing of a return showing taxable income\nH C a\nbe are not here concerned with the quantum hut only with the legality the assessment\nthe side issue whether in point of fact the cash credits in the name of the wife represented the income of the husband does not survive for decision\nthus the only question is whether the notice issued under a of of i lie Act on February of a law after the assessed filed his value try return on January a 1950 and the assessment thereon were valid in by\nsection of a of the Act provides that no assessment except the assessment within cd\na of such a a thereof or under a of to which cd\na of sub a a of a of applies shall be made after the expiry of four years from the encl of the year in which income profits or gains were first assessable\na proviso however allows one year from the date of the service of the notice for to he completion of the assess men\nit reads omitting matters not relevant here where a notice under sub section a has been issued within the time therein limited the assessment or reassessment to he made in pursuance of such S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 119 notice nay be made before the expiry of one year from the date of the service of the notice even if a sue per exp be a PS a per of\nour years\na of a the r959 the Commissioner of come tax a it is therefore quite clear that the extra period is available only if a notice under sub a a of a of has been issued within the time therein limited\nthis takes of to a of a\nBombay a Ranchlwddas Karsondas Bombay Sectic a of a omitting parts not relevant reads Hidayatullali J\na of a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessed to make a return of his income under section of for any year or a notwithstimrling that there has been no otis sion or failure as mentioned in clause a on the part of the assessed the Income tax Officer has in con sequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for any year he may in cases falling under clause a at any time within eight years and in cases falling under clause a at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the assessed a notice and may proceed to assess such income it would appear from this that if the return filed on January a 1950 was a return of income there was no failure or omission on the part of the assessed so as to bring the matter within a of a a of the Act and sub a a of a of would then apply to the case limiting the period to four years\nin that event the a sessmcnt should have been completed on or before March of 19b0\nbut if the return made by the assessed was no return at all then the conditions under the first sub section of a of obtained and the assessment could he completed within one year of the date of service of the notice a Iarch a 1950 i a\non or before March a 1951\nin that event the asses mint would be valid\nthe validity of the return in this context is tied to the validity of the notice and also i ice

made\nthere is no dispute a that a return could be filed in this case late though it was\nthe con traverse centres round the fact that the return when it was filed disclosed an income which was below

notice under a of a of that Act corresponding to a of a of the Act was served and a return showing an income below taxable minimum was filed\nthe contention was that without a notice under a of a

a or a of a\nChakravarti J\nas he then was and Das Gupta J held that a person who had no assessable income was not place a under a duty to file a return that the return whether filed under a of a or a

under the prove signs of section of a will therefore show an asses sable income A return which showed no assessable income could not possibly be treated as a return filed under section of a or a return called for under that section but filed under section of a when in fact it was filed in response to a notice under section of a\nthe opinion here expressed was criticised in the under appeal and in the next case judgment R K Das Go a Commissioner of Income tax the Calcutta High Court Chakravarti C J and Sarkar J\nexplained what was really meant\nit is not necessary to refer to the facts of that case\nthis is what Chakra writ C J observed at a 449 it should be remembered a observed that the return in the present case is being sought to be treated as a return under section of a belatedly filed\nand then a went on to say that a return under section of a would only be filed by a person who thought that he had a taxable income and therefore a return showing an income below the taxable limit could not be held on a construction thereof to be a return under section of a and consequently the return in the case we were then considering could not be treated as such a return filed under section of a\nto say that was not to say that even a return filed in compliance with a notice under section of a if filed belatedly under section of a could not be a return showing an income below the taxable limit\nthis left the matter somewhat ambiguous as to what was really meant and in Commissioner of Income of a a GovindlaJ Dutta Chakravarti C J and Guha J a 1956 of a a a\n439 a 1957 of a a a\n630\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 123 x959 again explained the true import of the law laid down\nthey referred to a of a of the Act as it stood prior to Th a\na commissioner the amendment of 1953 and observed that under that a Incom a as Bombay section a person was required to file a return only if his total income during the preceding year exceeded a the maximum amount which was not chargeable to Ranchhoddas tax\nthe return contemplated was thus only a return Karsondas Bombt1y of income and not a return of loss and not even a Hidayatullt1h J return of income but a return of taxable income\nnot only had a person no duty but he had even no right to file a return voluntarily if he had suffered a loss to report that loss\nthe learned Judges concluded that it was a complete mistake to think that a of a provided for the filing of a voluntary return showing loss at any time before assessment\nthat section they opined contemplated the filing of a return of taxable income and a return not showing such income was not a return at all in law\nthe Calcutta view as shown above really proceeds upon the wording of a of a\nit lays down that the public notice requires only persons having an income above the taxable limit to make a return\na person who has no such\nincome need not make a return and if he does make a return it is not a return which need be considered being not a return in law\nit is a little difficult to understand how the exist once of a return can be ignored once it has been filed\na return showing income below the\ntaxable limit can be made even in answer to a notice under a of a\nthe notice under a of a requires in a general way what a notice under a of a requires of an individual\nof a return of income below the taxable limit is a good return in answer to a notice under a of a there is no reason to think that a return of a similar kind in answer to a public notice is no return at all\nthe conclusion does not follow from the words of a of a\nto out to under that sub section only those persons a re required to make a return whose income is above taxable limits but a person may legitimately consider himself entitled to certain educ tons and allowances and yet file a return to be on the safe side\nbe may show his income and the 124 SUPREME COUii a REPORTS 1960 a 959 T a\nom1niss1oner of Incom tax Bombay\na Ranchhoddas deductions and allowances he claims\nbut it may be that on a correct processing his income may be found\nto be above the exempted hot No doubt it is futile for a person not liable to tax to rush in with a return

a and in the judgment under appeal\nthat view was accepted by the Madras High Court in P S Raina Iyer v Cornrnissioner of encore tax and also in our opinion is the sounder view of the two\nin the earlier of the two Bombay cases Chagla C J and Tendolkar J held as stated in the head note Notice under section of is only necessary if at to he end of the assessment year no return has been made by the assessed and the authorities wished to proceed under section of a but where the assessed himself chooses voluntarily to make a return no question can arise under section of of assessment escaping and therefore there is no necessity to serve any notice under section of\nthis represents the law applicable to the facts as they are to be found in this case\nin the assessment year no return of income was filed nor was any notice served under a of a\nthere was however the general notice under a of a\na return in answer to that notice could be filed under a of a before assessment it was filed on and for this there is no limit of time\nJanuary a 1950\nTh ere was nothing to prevent the Income tax officer from taking up the return and proceeding to assess the income of the assessed\nit was open to him if there a a sufficient justification for it to hold that the amount noted in the footnote was really the assessed a income in which case an assessable income would have been found and the tax could be charged thereon\nof the Income tax Officer had acted on that return and assessed the assessed a 1948 161 T R\nus\na 1957 of a a a 458 S C ARE SUPREME COURT REPORTS 125\na a of a Th\nbefore March of 1950 the assessment would have been valid\nbe chose to ignore the return and served on tie assessed a note a or a is notice was improper because with the return already filed there was neither an omission nor a failure on the part of the assessed nor was there any question of Ranchkoddas assessment escaping\nthe notice under a of a was Karsondas Bombay invalid and the consequent assessment therefore equally so\nvie accordingly agree with the judgment under appeal\nthe Commissioner of Income to\nBombay a H idayatullah z959\nbefore leaving this case we may refer to two other arguments which were raised\nMr Rajagopala Sastri pointed out that an assessed might file the voluntary ret right now on the last lay showing income less than the taxable limit and the Department would in that case be driven to complete the assessment proceed rings within a few hours or lose the right to send a notice under a of a\nin argument a inconvenient is not a decisive argument\nthe Income tax Officer could have avoided the result by issuing a notice under a of a and not remaining inactive until the period a a about to expire\nfurther all laws of limitation to some inconvenience and hard lead cases\nthe remedy is for the legislature to amend the law suitably\nthe courts can administer the laws as they find them and they are seldom required to be astute to de feat the law of limitation\nthis argue men is thus no answer to the dear meaning and implications of the Act\nthe other argument was that the return was not a true one and fell within the mischief of cd\na of sub a a of a of and that therefore the period during which action could be taken was the extended one of a years\nthe short answer to that is that this was not a part of the Department a case at any prior stage and can not be allowed to be raised now\nin our opinion the answers given by the High Court of Bombay were correct in all the circumstances of this case\nthe appeal thus fails and is dismissed

materially corroborated\na must also tell you that this rule as to corroboration has become a settled rule of proc time of so universal an application that it has now almost the force and reverence of law\nCorrobora ion must be as to the crime and the identity of each one of the accused and the corroboration require de must be independent evidence that is reliable evidence of another kind\nS O

this Court\nin dealing with the question what amount of corroboration is required you gentlemen must ever case careful discrimination and look at all the surrounding circumstances in order to arrive at a conclusion whether the facts deposed to by the approver Sastipada are borne out by those circus stances\nMr Umrigar on behalf of the appellant urged that the aforesaid direction given by Sessions Judge to the jury was not sufficient\nthe jury should have been told a in accordance with the decision of this Court in the case of Sarwan Singh a the State of Punjab a that the approver a evidence has to satisfy a double test\nit must show that he is a reliable witness and that his evidence receives sufficient corroboration a that the evidence of an approver must be confirmed not only as to the circumstances of the crime but also as to the identity of the prisoner\nthe corroboree ion a 1957 S C R\nof of 1959 nanendra Nath Ghose a the State of West Bengal Imam\n130 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a ought to consist in circumstances that affects the identity of the party accused\nreliance was placed on the case of the King a Baskerville a a that the circumstantial evidence corroborating the approver was not sufficient to connect the appellant with the murder of the deceased and a that on similar corridor action of the approver a testimony the accused J dish Gorain had been acquitted\nthere was no real distinct ion between the case of J dish Gorain and the appellant\nit is true that in Sarwan Singh a case this Court had held the appreciation of an approver a evidence has to satisfy a double test\nit must show that he is a reliable witness and that his evidence receives suffice end corroboration and that is a test which is common to all witnesses\nof this test is satisfied the second test which still remains to be applied is that the approver a evidence must receive sufficient corroboration\nthis test is special to the cases of weak or tainted evidence like that of the approver\nthese observations were made in the special circumstances of the case which this Court was deciding when dealing with the case of Sarwan Singh\nthis Court went on to observe the argument that the character of the approver a evil once has not been considered by the high Court can not be characterised as merely academic or the retinal in the present case because as we shall presently point out the evidence of the approver is so thoroughly discrepant that it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the approver in the present case is a wholly unreliable witness\nindeed it may be legitimate to point out that the learned Judges of the High Court have themselves criticised the evidence of the approver in dealing with the prosecution case against Gurdial Singh and have ultimately found that the account given by the approver is unreliable and though there was circumstantial evidence which raised an amount of suspicion against Gurdial Singh that would not be enough to sustain his conviction\nit seems to us that if it was found that the approver a account against one of the accused persons was wholly discrepant this a 1916 K B D\n658\nI959 a nanendra Nath Ghose a the State of West Bengal Imam\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 131 finding itself should inevitably have led the court to scrutinise his evidence in respect of the other accused persons with greater caution\nit is clear therefore that in the special circumstances of the case of Sarwan Singh the approver had been found to be a wholly unreliable witness\nit is important to observe that this Court stated that the approver a evidence must show that he is a reliable witness and that is the test which is common to all witnesses\nnothing has been shown to us in this case as was shown in Sarwan Singh a case that apart from the approver a testimony in the present case being regarded as tainted evidence his evidence as it stood was in any way unreliable\nindeed the Sessions Judge went to the length of telling the jury that although an approver a evidence is strictly admissible and a conviction is not illegal merely because it is based on an approver a evidence it was a settled rule of practice not to convict a person on such evidence except under very rare and except tonal circumstances and usually substantial cor roboratLm was required\nthe jury could not have been more clearly warned about the danger of acting on an approver a evidence\nin other words the jury were told not to convict the appellant on the approver a evidence unless his evidence had been substantially corroborated\npart from the question of corroborate ion of the approver a evidence nothing was suggested to us or to the high Court in what respect the approver a evidence was unreliable after testing his evidence in the same way as one would test the evil once of any witness for the prosecution in a criminal in our opinion the decision in Sarwan Singh a case\nin the present case\ncase can be distinguished obviously it was never suggested that the approver a evil once in this case was entirely unreliable if his evidence was tested in the same way as the evidence of any prosecution witness in a criminal trial\nbe can not accept the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the charge to the jury is vitiated because of the decision of this Court in Sarwa a Singh a case\nI959 J nanendra Nath Ghose a the Slate of West Ben gal Imam\n132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a is to the second submission made by Mr Umrigar it is to be remembered that in Baskerville a case the Court of Criminal Appeal in England after discussing various authorities on the subject came to the follow in conclusion be hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime\nin other words it must be evidence which implicates him that is which confirms in some a material part ocular not only the evidence that the crime has been committed but also that the prisoner committed it\nthe test applicable to determine the nature and extent\nof the corroboration is thus the same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or within that class of offences for which corr oration is required by statute\nthe language of the statute implicates the accused compendious in corporate the test applicable at common law in the rule of practice\nthe nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged\nit would be in high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as corroboration except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true not merely that the crime has been committed but that it was commit ted by the accused\nthe corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime it is suffice end if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime\nin the present case the jury had been clearly directed by the Sessions Judge that corroborative evidence must be evidence which implicates the accused i a which confirms in some material particulars not only the evidence that the crime had been committed but also that the appellant had committed it\nthe Sessions Judge told the jury that Corroborative I959 J nanendra Nath Ghose a the Stale of West Bengal Imam\na a R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 133 the accused committed evidence you should bear in mind is evidence which shows or tends to show to hat the story of the accomplice the crime is true\nthe that corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime\nit is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime\nthe corroboration in material particulars must be such a a to connect or identify each of the accused with the offence\nit seems to us that the Sessions Judge directed the jury in accordance with the principle laid down in Baskerville a case and no serious objection can be taken to the manner in which the Sessions Judge directed the jury in this respect\nthe moment there is corroborative evidence which connects or tends to connect an accused with the crime such corroborative evidence relates to the identity of the accused in connection with that crime\nit is the approver a evidence which is the direct evidence of the crime\nthere should be corroboration in material particulars not only concerning the crime but corridor action of the approver a story by evidence which connects or tends to connect an accused with the crime\nit is this corroborative evidence which deter mines the mind of the Court or a jury that the approver a evidence that the accused committed the crime is true\nis to the ord submission made on behalf of the appellant the following circumstances were established by the evidence which were accepted by the jury L there was a motive for the appellant to that is to say his immoral commit the crime proposal to Lila wife of the deceased\na\nin the with of May 1955 the appellant came to Lila a house and had a talk with the deceased\na\nin the with of May 1955 in the morning the appellant also came to the house and talked with the deceased\nwater on that very day a little after sunset the appellant came to the house and asked the deceased to go for a walk with him\nthe deceased did so\na\nthereafter the appellant was seen going with Jagdish Gorain and the deceased by Brojeswari and z959 Jumntlra Nath Glwss a the Slate of Wesl Bengal Imam\n134 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a Lila towards the north of the village after a a a while they were bathing in Talbona tank\na\naccording to the approver\nat the time that the deceased was stabbed by the appellant he had sustained an injury on the dorsum of his left palm\nthe medical evidence established that the appellant had an almost healed up ulcer to inch in length on the left side of the palm at its posterior surface one inch belowthewrist joint and another healed up ulcer inch in length on the left thumb at the posterior surface and that these injuries could be caused by a sharp cutting weapon like a knife\na\nis it had become night and the deceased had not returned Lila a mother Brojeswari and her uncle Radharaman Sadhu searched for him\nthey went to the club house where the appellant and his two co accused radish Gorain and Sudhir Gorain and the approver used to associate with each other\nwhen enquiries were made from the appellant by Brojeswari he first replied that the deceased had not gone with him and that he did not know anything about his whereabouts\nwhen he was remained that it was he who had taken the deceased for a walk which he was denying the appellant replied that the deceased went with him unto the canal towards north of the village but as he felt a headache he came away and it was not possible for the appellant to give any news about the deceased a whereabouts\ncircumstances either the above mentioned india visually or collectively may fall short of proving that the appellant committed the murder of the deceased\nindeed the high Court was of the opinion that these circumstances independent of the direct evidence of the approver would not be sufficient to induce any reasonable person to come to the conclusion that the appellant had committed the crime\nis already stated however the approver a evidence is the direct evidence which establishes that the appellant had murdered the deceased\nthe jury had to decide for themselves whether the above mentioned circus stances were sufficient corroborative evidence to satisfy S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 135 I959 nantndra N all Ghose a the State of West Bengal Imam\nthem that the approver a evidence that the appellant murdered the deceased was true\nit is however urged by Mr Umrigar that the circumstances mentioned were not circumstances corroborating the evidence of the approver in material particulars which would connect or tend to connect the appellant with the crime\nin our opinion at least in one circumstance the corroboration is in a very material particular connecting or tending to connect the appellant with the crime\nthe approver a evidence that while the appellant was murdering the deceased he had received an injury on the dorsum of his left palm is corroborate to\nde by the a medical evidence\nit was however pointed out that the medical evidence does not show that the injury was on the dorsum of the left palm\nin our opinion there is no substance in this submission because the first injury is described as one on the left side of the palm at its posterior surface a inch below the wrist joint that is to say the dorsum of the left a a pm\nthe second injury is clearly on the left thumb at its posterior surface which is also consistent with the evidence of the approver that the dorsum of the left a a pm was injured\nthe jury were entitled to accept this evidence as sufficient corroboration in a material particular connecting the appellant or\ntending to connect him with the crime\nin addition the cir cuesta once that it was the appellant who had called for the deceased a little after sunset and a a to ken him a way and thereafter was seen going a long towards the north of the village with the deceased and that thereafter the deceased was not seen a live was one upon which the jury could rely in coming to the conclusion that it connected or tended to connect the appellant with the crime\nthe appellant a pretended ignorance of the whereabouts of the deceased that very night and his ultimate admission that he had to ken the deceased towards the north of the village was also a circumstance upon which the jury could rely as inconsistent with his innocence\nin our opinion all the circumstances referred to above were sufficient corroboration of the approver a evidence connecting or tending to connect the appellant with 1959 Jnanmdra Nath Ghose a the State of West Bengal Imam\n136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a the crime and accordingly the approver a evidence that the appellant did commit the crime was true\nis to the eth submission that although there was similar corroboration of the approver a evidence against J dish Gorain but he had been acquitted by the jury although no real distinction between his case and the case of the appellant arose is unsound as in our opinion the two cases are not comparable\nin the first place there as no motive for J dish Gorain to commit the murder\nin the second place the injury which Jagdish received was while he caught the knife in the hand of the appellant saying what have you done\nthe approver a evidence therefore rather tended to show that he tried to prevent the appellant from further stabbing the deceased\nthese circumstances may have induced the jury to make a distinction between the case of Jagdish Gorain and the appel last\nit was for the jury to say whether they regarded the circumstantial evidence as sufficient to connect or tending to connect Jagdish with the crime\nit would seem that on the approver a evidence the jury may well have regarded the circumstances as insufficient corroboration to connect or tending to connect J dish Gorain with the crime\nin our opinion it\ncan not be said with anygood reason that there was any defect in the charge to the jury delivered by the Sessions Judge which would justify us in saying that the verdict of the jury was vitiated\nthe appeal is accordingly dismissed\nappeal dismissed', 'z959 Moy a\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 137 SHRI B P HIRA WORKS MANAGER CENTRAL RAILWAY

Central Rail way Workshop and Factory Pa rel Bombay and the to a M Prlld a\nhe had not been paid overtime wages due to him from April a 1949 to September of 1954\nthe respondent Gajn4ra11SdkM J claimed that the delay made by him in filing the present application should be condoned because jointly with his co workers he had been in correspondence with the railway administration in regard to the a id payment of overtime wages since 1948 and that the claim a de by him and his colleagues had been finally rejected by the railway administration on August of 1954\nis case was that he had filed the present apply action soon thereafter and so the delay made by him in making the claim before the Authority should be condoned\nthe Authority heard the parties on the question of delay and held that the delay only in re a pet of the claim for the period after May 1953 should be condoned\nin the result the claim for overtime wages for the period prior to May of 1953 was rejected on the preliminary ground of delay whereas the claim for the period subsequent to the a id a the a a con ordered on the merits the respondent a a be a a that he was entitled to the overtime wages for work on

1948 the Act\nthus the claim for\nhereafter called 140 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a z959 overtime wages was made by the respondent on two alternative grounds\nB P Hir the appellant disputed the validity of this claim\na M Prod Jan it was urged on its behalf that the respondent was not a worker under a a a of the factories Act and that Gojm4ro1 do a J a of of the Act did not justify the claim alternatively made by the respondent for overtime wages\nthe Authority considered the evidence led before it in respect of all the respondents for overtime wages\nit appears that these respondents are employed by the appellant in the time office of the Pare\nWorkshop and not in the factory itself\nthe duties of these time keepers are to maintain initial records of attendance of workshop staff to prepare pay sheets for them to maintain their leave accounts to dispose of final settle men cases of the said staff and to maintain records for statistical information\nthe Authority held that the time office where the timekeepers work is an intel real part of the factory and so it came to the conclusion that the timekeepers are employed in the factory called the Central Railway Workshop and Factory Parel Bombay\nthe Authority then examined\nthe question as to whether the timekeepers are workers within the mean in of a a a of the Factories Act\nevidence showed that four timekeepers are required to do the work of progress timekeepers\nthis work consists in preparing the progress time sheets and operation time sheets of machine shop staff working on various jobs dealing with the production of railway spare parts\nthe Allthority was disposed to take the view that having regard to the nature of the work assigned to the progress time keepers they must be held to be persons employed in work incidental to or connected with the manual turing process or the subject of the manufacturing process and as such they are workers within the mean in of a a a of the Factories Act\nin the result the finding made by the Authority was that timekeepers are employees of the workshop but are not workers under the Factories Act while the progress time keepers can claim the status of workers under the said Act\nS C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 141 B\nz959\nP H a a the Authority then considered the respondent a argument that even if he was not a worker under the Factories Act he was nevertheless entitled to claim the benefit of a of of the said Act by virtue of a of a M Pradharl of the Act\nthe Authority accepted this contention and held that even if the respondent was not a Ga1enaragadkar J worker under the Factories Act a of of the Act entitled him to claim overtime wages under a of of the Factories Act\nthat is why the authority that the respondents would be entitled ordered for the period of a 1953 to of a 1954 to overtime wages at double the ordinary rate for the Sundays on which they worked when they were not given a a holiday on one of the three days immediately preceding or after the said Sunday\nthe appellant was accordingly directed to file a statement showing the overtime wages to which the several respondents were entitled and orders were passed on each one of the applications directing the appellant to pay the respective amounts to each one of the respondents\nit is against these orders that the appellant has filed the present group of appeals by special leave\nthe first point which has been urged before us by the learned Attorney General on behalf of the appel last is that the Authority was in error in holding that the progress timekeepers are workers under a a a of the Factories Act\na worker under a a a means a person employed directly or through any agency whether for wages or not in any manufacturing pro cess or in cleaning any part of the machinery or premises used for manufacturing process or in any other kind of work incidental to or connected with the manufacturing process or the subject of the manufacturing process and the manufacturing pro cess under a a a means any process for inter asia a making altering repairing ornamenting finishing packing oiling washing cleaning breaking up demolishing or otherwise treating or adapting any article or substance with a view to its use sale transport delivery or disposal\nit is clear that the duties of the progress timekeepers do not fall within the first a it of a a a\nthe Authority has however 142 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a z959 held that the said duties can be treated as incidental to or connected with the manufacturing process or the subject of manufacturing process it is the a M Pradhan correctness of this finding that is challenged by the B P Hira appellant\nGaj 1raga4har J\nin the other hand Mr Purshottam for the res pendents argues that the Authority was in error in holding that the timekeepers are not workers under a a a\nis contention is that the expression incidental to or connected with the manufacturing process is wide enough to include not only the cases of the progress timekeepers but the cases of all time keepers as a class\nit is true that the finding of the Authority in respect of the timekeepers is against the respondents but Mr Purshottam says that he is entitled to support the final order passed by the Authority on the additional ground that the time keepers like the progress timekeepers are workers under a a a and as such they are entitled to claim overtime wages under a of of the Factories Act\nthe final decision of the Authority is however based on the view that under a of of the Act the respondents would be entitled to overtime wages under a of of the Factories Act even if they are not workers under a a a\nthat being so we think it is necessary first to consider the correctness of this view\nof the conclusion of the Authority on the scop a and effect of the provisions of a of of the Act is correct then it would be unnecessary to consider whether the timekeepers and the progress timekeepers are workers under a a a of the Factories Act\nbe would there fore deal with that question first\nit appears that there are three statutes which pro vide for the payment of extra\nwages for overtime work\nthe proviso to a of a of the Indian Railways Act IX of 1890 lays down that the exempted railway servant specified in it shall be a id for overtime at not less than one and a quarter times his ordinary rate of pay\nthis provision has been subsequently amended by Act 59of1956 which makes the rate for overtime one and one half times the ordinary rate of pay but it is common ground that we are not S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 143 z959 a a B P Hir11 a a to is suggest concerned with the a mended provision in these appeals since the respondents claim is for a period prior to a\nthe date of the amendment\na to a appellant that the respondents are railway servants a M Pradhlln under a a a of the said Act and as such they may be entitled to make a claim for overtime wages under Gajendragadkar J the said proviso but the respondents have not made and do not wish to make a claim under the said provision and so the question as to the application of the said section need not detain us\nof the con striction placed on a of of the Act by the Authority is cor rect the claims of employees who are working in a factory in the State of Bombay would be governed by that provision this position is not seriously dis muted before us\nsection of of the Factories Act also deals with the question of extra\nwages for overtime\nit provides for the payment of wages in respect of overtime work at the rate of twice the ordinary rate of wages\nthis benefit is however available only to persons who a re workers within the meaning of a a a of the said Act since we are dealing with the a be on the assumption that the respondents are not workers under a a a it follows that a of by itself would not be applicable to them\nthe Bombay Shops and Establishments Act 1948 is the third statute which makes a provision for the payment of extra wages for overtime work\nsection of of the Act deals with this topic\nsection of a provides for the payment of overtime work at the rate of H times the ordinary rate of a get in the case of employees in any establishment other than a residential hotel restaurant or eating house whereas sub a a provides for wages for overtime at the rate of twice the ordinary rate of wages in respect of employees in a residential hotel restaurant or eating house subject to the other conditions specified in the said section\nit is clear that this section does not apply to the respondents because they are employees in a factory and not in any of the establishments enumerated in its two sub sections\n144 SUPREM COURT REPORTS 1960 a z959 B P HiY the respondents case however is that by virtue of a of of the Act the provisions of the Factories Act including a of are extended to the cases of all them a M Pradhan players in factories and so they are entitled to claim wages for overtime under the said section of the Gajendragadkar J\nfactories Act\nthis contention has been upheld by the Authority\nit is not disputed by the appellant to that the Bombay Legislature was competent prescribe for the extension of the provisions of the Factories Act to employees in the factories within the territory of the State of Bombay and since sanction for this legislation has been duly obtained from the Governor General of India on January a 1949 no question about all by repugnance between the prove signs of a of and those of the Factories Act can pos silly a rise\nthus the validity of the said section is not in dispute and so the only point which calls for our decision is one of construction Does a of supplement the provisions of the Factories Act by extending them to all employees in factories like the respondents though they are not workers under a a a of the said Act\nbefore dealing with this point it is necessary to refer briefly to the broad features of the Act\nthe Act no doubt is a piece of beneficent social legislation intended to serve the because of labour welfare\nit has been passed in order to consolidate and amend the law relating to the regular ion and conditions of work and employment in shops commercial establishments residential hotels restaurants eating houses theatres other places of public amusements and entertainments and other establishments\nsection a sub is\na a and of define respectively the establishment comer dial establishment and shop\nthe definitions of com mercia establishment and shop exclude inter asia

R\nSUPREME COURT REJ OH TS 145 I959 B\na\nHira a to be an establishment for the purposes of this Act\nit would be noticed that the definition of establishment is very wide and it does not purport to be exhaustive because it expressly empowers the State Government a M Pradhan to include within its purview by notification other\nestablishments not specified in it\nsection a sub a a Ga1endragadliar J defines an employee as meaning a person wholly or principally employed in and in connection with any establishment and includes an apprentice hut does not include a member of the employer a family\nthis definition shows that the Act intends to confer the benefit of its provision on all persons who fall within the wide definition of the expression Employee\nit is necessary at this stage to refer to the definition of factory under the Act\nsection a a defines a factory as meaning any premises which is a factory within the meaning of cd\na of a a of the factories A it or which is deemed to be a factory under a of of the said Act\nrows\na a of the Factories Act defines a factory as meaning any premises including the precincts thereof i whereon ten or more workers are working or

more workers are working or were working on airy day of the preceding twelve months and in any part of which a manufacturing process is being carried on without the aid of power or is ordinarily so

definition of factory to other places subject to the requirements specified in the said section\nit is common ground that the place where the respond dents are employed is a factory under a a a of the i factories Act and so it satisfies the definition of a a a of the Act\nof 146 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a zero the scheme of the Act shows that it deals separately with shops and commercial establishments cd\nIII a P Hfra residential hotels restaurants and eating houses cd\na M Pradhan IV and theatres and other places of public amusement cd\na\nseparate provisions are made to regulate Gajendragadkar J these different establishments having regard to the special needs of each one of them\nthere are however general provisions applicable to and regulating all the establishments alike and these are found in chs\nVI to of\nit is significant that with the exception of a of no other section of the Act deals with factories\nbe have already noticed that in defining com mercia establishment and shop respectively the Act has expressly excluded factories from the said expressions\nit is true that the definition of establish men does not expressly exclude factory but it is plain that factory is treated by the Act as separate and distinct and there can be no doubt that the provisions in the Act which apply to establishment are not in other intended to and do not apply to factories\nwords though the definition of establishment is wide enough it does not include factory for the our poses of the Act\nit is conceivable that a kitchen attached to an establishment like a residential hotel may satisfy the definition of factory but it seems to us that such an adjunct of an establishment is prime face not intended by the Act to be treated apart and separately from the main establishment itself and so it would be taken as a part of the establishment and be governed by the provisions of the Act in relation thereto\nthe factory where the respondents are employed is not connected with much less an insofar able adjunct of any establishment and so this act dec aspect of the matter which was incidentally posed before us by the learned Attorney General need not be pursued any further in the present appeal\nthe conclusion of the Authority has been challenged by the appellant on the ground that a of on which it is based can not be invoked by the respondents\nin support of this argument reliance is placed on a a of the Act\nsection a provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act its provisions mentioned S C R\nSUPREME COUR a REPORTS 147 a a z959 of a B P Hira a in the third column of sch\nII shall not apply to the establishments employees and other persons men would a toned against them in to a second co mun of to a said schedule\nthe proviso to this section authorises the a M Pradhan State Government to add to omit or alter any of the entries in the said schedule in the manner indicated Gajentlragatlkar J by it\nit is urged that the establishment of any rail way administration is mentioned as or no\na in sch\nII and the entry against it in col a of the said schedule shows that the provisions of the Act are inapplicable to the said establishments\nof the establishment in question is exempted from the application of all the provisions of the Act how can a of be said to apply to it\nasks the learned Attorney General\nit is obvious that is\na mentions and applies only to establishments and it has no application to factories and we are dealing with employees in a factory\nindeed as we have already observed no provision of the Act except a of applies to factories and so it would not be legit mate to base any argument on the assumption that a a is applicable to the present case\nincidentally the learned Attorney General suggested though faintly that the establishments mentioned at or nos\na to a in col a of sch\nII are wider than and different from the establishment as defined by a a a\nbe do not think that this suggestion is well founded\nthere can be no doubt that is\na grants exemptions to the said establishments from the application of the provisions mentioned in col a of sch\nII and that itself postulates that but for the exemption thus granted the provisions of the Act would have applied indeed the scheme of sch\nof shows that to them\nwhereas all the provisions of the Act are made inapplic able to the establishments and offices enumerated at or nos\na to a including a a to a a in regard to the others which are enumerated at or nos\na to of it is only some provisions of the Act specified in col a that are excluded\nin other words the remaining sections not so specified would apply to them\nof that is so they must be and are establishments under a a a of the Act\n148 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1960 a a 959 B P Hira a M Pradhan in this connection it must be borne in mind that a a a empowers the State Government to include by notification any office or institution within the define ion of establishment and so the inclusion of any such office or institution in col a of sch\nII would make it Gajcndragadkar J an establishment under the Act and as such it would be governed by it subject of course to the correspond in entry in col a\nthat is why we think that the suggestion of the learned Attorney General as to the denotation and character of establishments enumerate de in or nos\na to a in col a of sch\nII can not be accepted\nall the offices establishments and other institutions mentioned in col a of sch\nII are and must be held to be establishments under a a a\nin regard to the argument that the\noperation of a a excludes the application of a of we have held that a a applies only to establishments and not to factories\nbut even ifs\na is assumed to be applicable to factories we do not think it would materially affect the applied ion of a of\nthe plain object underlying a of and its context emphatically point out that it is intended to operate independently of the other provisions of the Act and in that sense it stands apart from them\nit is this aspect of the matter which is clarified by the Legislature by laying down in a of that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to apply to any persons employed in the factory\nthat however anticipates the argue men on the construction of a of\nget us therefore cite the said section and construe it\nsection of provides that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to any person employed in or within the precincts of a factory and the provisions of the Factories Act shall notwithstanding anything in the said Act apply to such person\nthis section consists of two parts\nthe first part makes it clear that no provision in the Act shall be deemed to apply to the persons specified in it\nthe Legislature knew that in fact the Act contained no provision which in terms or expressly applies to any such person but in order to remove any possible doubt it has provided that no provision in the Act shall even by inference or fiction be deemed to apply to them\nin other words this clause S C R\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS 149 A is intended to clarify the position that though factory has been defined by a a a of the Act no provision of the it is intel de to be applied to a factory or employees in it\nhaving clarified this position the a M Pradhan second part of the section extends the application of the Factories Act to the said persons\nB P Hira a Ga1endragadkar J\na I959 it would have been possible for the Legislature to include in the present statute a of the relevant provisions of the Factories Act and make them applicable to factories as defined by a a a but apparently the Legislature thought that the same object can be achieved by enacting the second part of a of\nthis part provides that the provisions of the Factories Act shall a apply to the persons in question notwithstanding anything contained in the said Act\nthe said Act contains the provision by which workers are defined under a a a and it necessarily involves the cons queue that the relevant provision about the payment of of time wages applies only to workers as defined and not to employees in factories who are not workers\nit is in reference to this provision that a of has prove de to list notwithstanding the said provision the relevant provisions of the Factories Act will apply to persons employed in a factory\nthe non obstacle clause in a a thus serves the purpose of clarifying the position thatcher Factories Act is made applicable to employees in factories and that they are not governed by any of the Jrovisions of the Act\nthis conclusion is\nobviously come stent with the policy of the Act\nit has itself mac provision for the payment of overtime wages to employees in all establishments by a of and it has made applicable inter asia the relevant provisions of the factories Act in regard to employees in factories\nTha1 is the view which the Authority has taken and in for opinion its validity or correctness is not open to doubt\nInthe result the orders passed by the authority are confirmed and the appeals are dismissed with costs in one set\nappeals dismissed', 'SECURITIES AND

Harish Biyani who purchased Page of of of a of 000 shares\nthe balance a of 000 shares were purchased by a brokers belonging to the D K Singhania group\nit was later brought out that the CSE had expunged the entire transactions of a of 000 shares on the ground that they were non genuine transactions\na of Shri Harish Biyani stated that it bought these shares for client Kettlewell Tracom\nit is pertinent to note that address of Kettelwell is same as that of Hulda and also one of the directors and contact person of this entity is Mr Manoj Kumar Bhalotia who is also a director of M a\nHulda Properties and Trades Limited\ntherefore Kettelwell Commodities Limited also is an entity of DSQ group\nthe transactions done by Biyani group of brokers in the sell a cash scheme of SCHIL on of a of and a a of and cash on payout scheme on a a of in the shares of DSQ Industries is strong pointer to the promoter broker nexus between DSQ Group and Biyani group of brokers\npromoters colluded with Biyani group in obtaining finance on account of Biyani brokers facing payment crises on the CSE\nis discussed in detail later funds to the tune of approximately Rs\nof crore and Rs\na crore were availed on of a of and a a of in the sell a cash scheme of SHCIL\nthus funds were made available on the same date as the transaction date\nthereafter funds to the extent of around Rs\nof crore was availed for cash on payout transactions done on a a of\nthis amount was made available on a a of by discounting a post dated cheque given by SHC IL\na of in view of the foregoing it can be concluded that Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani had acted in concert with the promoters and its associate entities Hulda Square D Textiles which credited shares of DSQ Industries to the death account of Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani\nshares of promoter entities were also credited through SMIFS Securities Ltd Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani then used these shares in addition to other shares lying with it to avail of Page of of of the schemes of SHCIL to obtain immediate sale consideration in the sell a cash scheme of SHCIL as discussed above\nBiyani Securities Pvt\nLtd was empanelled broker of SHCIL for selling the shares in the said schemes\nBiyani Securities Pvt\nLtd availed finance for self as well as for Shri Harish Biyani for selling these shares in the schemes\nthe buying broker was Shri Harish Biyani who was buying shares for DSQ group entities\nshares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and selling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and quantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy orders\nBiyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani indulged in creation of artificial market creation of artificial volumes as a result of synchronization prior intention to matching orders\nthere was creation of artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization in logging in matching of buy and sell orders\norders are placed within a gap of few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani for the same quantity and same rate to ensure that buyers get the desired sellers and vice versa\nshares effectively did not change beneficial ownership by remaining within the DSQ group\nthus there was circular trading also\nthe transactions also created artificial market\na of a also note that when Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd sold a of 000 shares on the buying side Harish Biyani purchased a of 000 shares\nthe balance a of 000 shares were purchased by the Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt\nLtd and Doe Jones Investments Consultants Pvt\nLtd who were brokers at the relevant time and belonged to the D K Singhania group a of 000 shares each\na of in appeal no of of 2002 Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt\nLtd is SEBI the Hon be Securities Appellate Tribunal has held as under with regard to synchronized deals page of of of BEB has been charged for synchronized deals with First Global\na have examined the data provided by the parties on this issue\na find many transactions between BEB and FGSB\nthere are many instances of such transactions\na find the scrip quantity and price for these orders had been synchronized by the counter party brokers\nsuch transactions undoubtedly create an artificial market to mislead the genuine investors\nsynchronized trading is violative of all prudential and transparent norms of trading in securities\nsynchronized trading on a large scale can create false volumes\nthe argument that the parties had no means of knowing whether any entity controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any contra order elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading system confidentiality of counter parties is ensured is untenable\nit was submitted by the appellants that it was not possible for the broker to know who the counter party broker is and that trades were not synchronized but it was only a coincidence in some cases\ntheoretically this is of\nbut when parties decide to synchronize the transaction the story is different\nthere are many transactions giving an impression that these were all synchronized otherwise there was no possibility of such perfect matching of quantity price etc\nis the Respondent rightly stated it is too much of a coincidence over too long a period in too many transactions when both parties to the transaction had entered buy and sell orders for the same quantity of shares almost simultaneously such transactions wherein the buy and sell orders were entered almost simultaneously and the time lag is just under few seconds as aforesaid and the transactions are matched in terms of order quantity price and time are highly irregular and defeat the purpose of normal order matching system in the price discovery process in the exchanges and would also be in violation of Regulation of a of SEBI Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market 1995 which reads as under Page of of of Prohibition against market manipulation\na to persons shall a effect take part in or enter into either directly or indirectly transactions in securities with the intention of artificially raising or depressing the prices of securities and thereby inducing the sale or purchase of securities by any person a indulge in any act which is calculated to create a false or misleading appearance of trading on the securities markets a indulge in any act which results in reflection of prices of securities based on transactions that are not genuine trade transactions a enter into a purchase or sale of any securities not intended to effect transfer of beneficial ownership but intended to operate only as a device to inflate depress or because fluctuation in the market price of securities a of is already noted above when Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd sold a a lac shares of DSQ Industries Shri Harish Biyani purchased a a lac shares and the rest were purchased by Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt\nLtd and Doe Jones Investments Consultants Pvt\nLtd\nit is therefore concluded that the brokers viz\nShri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd acted in concert with the promoters of DSQ Group for creation of artificial market and rise in prices by entering into irregular transactions by way of synchronized trades and cross deals in which the order quantity time and prices are matched financing of trades through the schemes of SHCIL etc\nas discussed above Acting in concert is something about which actual evidence is normally difficult to come\nthe Supreme Court had dealt with the issue in the case of CIT vs East Coast Commercial Co Ltd AIR 1967 SC 768 Kedia Family case in the context of Section 23A of the indian Income Tax Act 1922 wherein the question was whether Kedia family had acted in concert Page of of of to control the affairs of the concerned company\nin the facts of that case there was no evidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in concert and thereby constituted and acted as a block\nin para of of the judgement the SC observed as follows\nit is sufficient if having regard to their relation etc their conduct and their common interest that it may be inferred that they must be acting together evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult to obtain and is not insisted upon a 772 hence it is clear from the above that Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani had together indulged in creation of artificial market artificial price rise giving misleading appearance of trades and hence have violated Regulation a of SEBI Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market Regulations 1995 as aforesaid\na of the method and manner of execution of these transactions whereby the order price quantity and time are matched was highly irregular and against the normal price discovery mechanism in Stock Exchanges\nit was contended that Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd and Harish Biyani are separate and distinct entities\nwhile the former is a company registered under the Companies Act 1956 the latter is an individual broking firm\nis such it was contended that both of them can not be clubbed together for the aforesaid show because notice for irregular transactions\na of the JPC Report dated of of 2002 on stock market scam at para a of observed that a number of large brokers have more than one card in CSE which are either in the name of their family members or companies where they are major shareholders\nShri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd are amongst such brokers\npage of of of a of the net outstanding position of Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd to the CSE where they were declared defaulters by the Exchange are as under Sr Name of the Defaulter Net Oustanding No\na\na\nSettl Sett Settl\nto 148 to 149 to 150 Shri Harish Biyani Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd of of a of a of a of a of a of of of a of is\nin crores total get outstanding both Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd were declared defaulters on of a 2001 by the CSE\none of the reasons for the payment problem at CSE was building up of large outstanding positions by few brokers in few scrips mainly in HFCL and DSQ and volatility in the prices during the relevant period\nin this context the Hon be Supreme Court decision in Delhi Development Authority is Skipper Construction Co Pvt Ltd 1996 a Comp LJ 233 SC AIR 1996 SC 2005 that para of at page 247 of COMP LJ may be referred to\nthe concept of corporate entity was evolved to encourage and promote trade and commerce but not to commit illegalities or to defraud people\nthere therefore the corporate character is employed for the purpose of committing illegality or defrauding others the court would ignore the corporate character and i all look at the reality behind the corporate veil so as to enable it to pass appropriate orders to do justice between the parties concerned\nthe fact that an individual and members of his family have created several corporate bodies would not prevent the court from treating Page of of of all of them as one entity belonging to and controlled by that individual and family\nof it is found that these corporate bodies are merely cloaks behind which lurks the individual and or members of his family and that the device of incorporation was really a ploy adopted for committing illegalities and or to defraud people underlining supplied\nacting in concert is something about which actual evidence is normally difficult to come\nthe Hon be Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs East Coast Commercial Co Ltd\nAIR 1967 SC 768 Kedia Family case in the context of Section 23A of the indian Income Tax Act 1922 wherein the question was whether Kedia family had acted in concert to control the affairs of the concerned company\nin the facts of that case there was no evidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in concert and thereby constituted and acted as a block\nin para of of the judgment the SC observed as follows if the members of the Kedia family form a block and had more than of per cent of the voting power it was not necessary to prove that they actually exercised controlling interest\nit is the holding in aggregate of a majority of the shares issued by a person or persons acting in concert in relation to the affairs of the company which establishes the existence of a block\nit is sufficient if having regard to their relation etc their conduct and their common interest that it may be inferred that they must be acting together evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult to obtain and is not insisted upon a 772 italics added\na of the evidence of connected circumstances and preponderance of probabilities common course of natural events and combination of facts creating network and artificial volumes gives rise to a reasonable inference that Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani did not act Page of of of in good faith and without negligence when they had executed these transactions\nthe standard of proof required in a proceeding of this nature is at variance with the standard of proof required in criminal cases\nit is sufficient if the preponderance of probabilities suggests towards the indulgence of the delinquent in the misconduct\nthe strict rules of Evidence Act and proof beyond reasonable doubt are not applicable to a proceeding of this nature\nthe Supreme Court a decision in Gulabchand is Kudilal AIR 1966 SC 1734 and the decision of the special Court for trial of offences relating to transactions in securities in the matter of National Housing Bank versus ANZ Grindlays Bank 1998 a LJ 153 is relied upon in this regard\na a ORDER now therefore having regard to the nature and gravity of the charges established against Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani a hereby in

Harish Biyani who purchased Page of of of a of 000 shares\nthe balance a of 000 shares were purchased by a brokers belonging to the D K Singhania group\nit was later brought out that the CSE had expunged the entire transactions of a of 000 shares on the ground that they were non genuine transactions\na of Shri Harish Biyani stated that it bought these shares for client Kettlewell Tracom\nit is pertinent to note that address of Kettelwell is same as that of Hulda and also one of the directors and contact person of this entity is Mr Manoj Kumar Bhalotia who is also a director of M a\nHulda Properties and Trades Limited\ntherefore Kettelwell Commodities Limited also is an entity of DSQ group\nthe transactions done by Biyani group of brokers in the sell a cash scheme of SCHIL on of a of and a a of and cash on payout scheme on a a of in the shares of DSQ Industries is strong pointer to the promoter broker nexus between DSQ Group and Biyani group of brokers\npromoters colluded with Biyani group in obtaining finance on account of Biyani brokers facing payment crises on the CSE\nis discussed in detail later funds to the tune of approximately Rs\nof crore and Rs\na crore were availed on of a of and a a of in the sell a cash scheme of SHCIL\nthus funds were made available on the same date as the transaction date\nthereafter funds to the extent of around Rs\nof crore was availed for cash on payout transactions done on a a of\nthis amount was made available on a a of by discounting a post dated cheque given by SHC IL\na of in view of the foregoing it can be concluded that Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani had acted in concert with the promoters and its associate entities Hulda Square D Textiles which credited shares of DSQ Industries to the death account of Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani\nshares of promoter entities were also credited through SMIFS Securities Ltd Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani then used these shares in addition to other shares lying with it to avail of Page of of of the schemes of SHCIL to obtain immediate sale consideration in the sell a cash scheme of SHCIL as discussed above\nBiyani Securities Pvt\nLtd was empanelled broker of SHCIL for selling the shares in the said schemes\nBiyani Securities Pvt\nLtd availed finance for self as well as for Shri Harish Biyani for selling these shares in the schemes\nthe buying broker was Shri Harish Biyani who was buying shares for DSQ group entities\nshares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and selling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and quantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy orders\nBiyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani indulged in creation of artificial market creation of artificial volumes as a result of synchronization prior intention to matching orders\nthere was creation of artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization in logging in matching of buy and sell orders\norders are placed within a gap of few seconds by Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani for the same quantity and same rate to ensure that buyers get the desired sellers and vice versa\nshares effectively did not change beneficial ownership by remaining within the DSQ group\nthus there was circular trading also\nthe transactions also created artificial market\na of a also note that when Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd sold a of 000 shares on the buying side Harish Biyani purchased a of 000 shares\nthe balance a of 000 shares were purchased by the Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt\nLtd and Doe Jones Investments Consultants Pvt\nLtd who were brokers at the relevant time and belonged to the D K Singhania group a of 000 shares each\na of in appeal no of of 2002 Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt\nLtd is SEBI the Hon be Securities Appellate Tribunal has held as under with regard to synchronized deals page of of of BEB has been charged for synchronized deals with First Global\na have examined the data provided by the parties on this issue\na find many transactions between BEB and FGSB\nthere are many instances of such transactions\na find the scrip quantity and price for these orders had been synchronized by the counter party brokers\nsuch transactions undoubtedly create an artificial market to mislead the genuine investors\nsynchronized trading is violative of all prudential and transparent norms of trading in securities\nsynchronized trading on a large scale can create false volumes\nthe argument that the parties had no means of knowing whether any entity controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any contra order elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading system confidentiality of counter parties is ensured is untenable\nit was submitted by the appellants that it was not possible for the broker to know who the counter party broker is and that trades were not synchronized but it was only a coincidence in some cases\ntheoretically this is of\nbut when parties decide to synchronize the transaction the story is different\nthere are many transactions giving an impression that these were all synchronized otherwise there was no possibility of such perfect matching of quantity price etc\nis the Respondent rightly stated it is too much of a coincidence over too long a period in too many transactions when both parties to the transaction had entered buy and sell orders for the same quantity of shares almost simultaneously such transactions wherein the buy and sell orders were entered almost simultaneously and the time lag is just under few seconds as aforesaid and the transactions are matched in terms of order quantity price and time are highly irregular and defeat the purpose of normal order matching system in the price discovery process in the exchanges and would also be in violation of Regulation of a of SEBI Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market 1995 which reads as under Page of of of Prohibition against market manipulation\na to persons shall a effect take part in or enter into either directly or indirectly transactions in securities with the intention of artificially raising or depressing the prices of securities and thereby inducing the sale or purchase of securities by any person a indulge in any act which is calculated to create a false or misleading appearance of trading on the securities markets a indulge in any act which results in reflection of prices of securities based on transactions that are not genuine trade transactions a enter into a purchase or sale of any securities not intended to effect transfer of beneficial ownership but intended to operate only as a device to inflate depress or because fluctuation in the market price of securities a of is already noted above when Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd sold a a lac shares of DSQ Industries Shri Harish Biyani purchased a a lac shares and the rest were purchased by Arihant Exim Scrip Pvt\nLtd and Doe Jones Investments Consultants Pvt\nLtd\nit is therefore concluded that the brokers viz\nShri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd acted in concert with the promoters of DSQ Group for creation of artificial market and rise in prices by entering into irregular transactions by way of synchronized trades and cross deals in which the order quantity time and prices are matched financing of trades through the schemes of SHCIL etc\nas discussed above Acting in concert is something about which actual evidence is normally difficult to come\nthe Supreme Court had dealt with the issue in the case of CIT vs East Coast Commercial Co Ltd AIR 1967 SC 768 Kedia Family case in the context of Section 23A of the indian Income Tax Act 1922 wherein the question was whether Kedia family had acted in concert Page of of of to control the affairs of the concerned company\nin the facts of that case there was no evidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in concert and thereby constituted and acted as a block\nin para of of the judgement the SC observed as follows\nit is sufficient if having regard to their relation etc their conduct and their common interest that it may be inferred that they must be acting together evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult to obtain and is not insisted upon a 772 hence it is clear from the above that Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani had together indulged in creation of artificial market artificial price rise giving misleading appearance of trades and hence have violated Regulation a of SEBI Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market Regulations 1995 as aforesaid\na of the method and manner of execution of these transactions whereby the order price quantity and time are matched was highly irregular and against the normal price discovery mechanism in Stock Exchanges\nit was contended that Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd and Harish Biyani are separate and distinct entities\nwhile the former is a company registered under the Companies Act 1956 the latter is an individual broking firm\nis such it was contended that both of them can not be clubbed together for the aforesaid show because notice for irregular transactions\na of the JPC Report dated of of 2002 on stock market scam at para a of observed that a number of large brokers have more than one card in CSE which are either in the name of their family members or companies where they are major shareholders\nShri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd are amongst such brokers\npage of of of a of the net outstanding position of Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd to the CSE where they were declared defaulters by the Exchange are as under Sr Name of the Defaulter Net Oustanding No\na\na\nSettl Sett Settl\nto 148 to 149 to 150 Shri Harish Biyani Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd of of a of a of a of a of a of of of a of is\nin crores total get outstanding both Shri Harish Biyani and Biyani Securities Pvt Ltd were declared defaulters on of a 2001 by the CSE\none of the reasons for the payment problem at CSE was building up of large outstanding positions by few brokers in few scrips mainly in HFCL and DSQ and volatility in the prices during the relevant period\nin this context the Hon be Supreme Court decision in Delhi Development Authority is Skipper Construction Co Pvt Ltd 1996 a Comp LJ 233 SC AIR 1996 SC 2005 that para of at page 247 of COMP LJ may be referred to\nthe concept of corporate entity was evolved to encourage and promote trade and commerce but not to commit illegalities or to defraud people\nthere therefore the corporate character is employed for the purpose of committing illegality or defrauding others the court would ignore the corporate character and i all look at the reality behind the corporate veil so as to enable it to pass appropriate orders to do justice between the parties concerned\nthe fact that an individual and members of his family have created several corporate bodies would not prevent the court from treating Page of of of all of them as one entity belonging to and controlled by that individual and family\nof it is found that these corporate bodies are merely cloaks behind which lurks the individual and or members of his family and that the device of incorporation was really a ploy adopted for committing illegalities and or to defraud people underlining supplied\nacting in concert is something about which actual evidence is normally difficult to come\nthe Hon be Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs East Coast Commercial Co Ltd\nAIR 1967 SC 768 Kedia Family case in the context of Section 23A of the indian Income Tax Act 1922 wherein the question was whether Kedia family had acted in concert to control the affairs of the concerned company\nin the facts of that case there was no evidence of any overt act showing that they were acting in concert and thereby constituted and acted as a block\nin para of of the judgment the SC observed as follows if the members of the Kedia family form a block and had more than of per cent of the voting power it was not necessary to prove that they actually exercised controlling interest\nit is the holding in aggregate of a majority of the shares issued by a person or persons acting in concert in relation to the affairs of the company which establishes the existence of a block\nit is sufficient if having regard to their relation etc their conduct and their common interest that it may be inferred that they must be acting together evidence of actual concerted acting is normally difficult to obtain and is not insisted upon a 772 italics added\na of the evidence of connected circumstances and preponderance of probabilities common course of natural events and combination of facts creating network and artificial volumes gives rise to a reasonable inference that Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani did not act Page of of of in good faith and without negligence when they had executed these transactions\nthe standard of proof required in a proceeding of this nature is at variance with the standard of proof required in criminal cases\nit is sufficient if the preponderance of probabilities suggests towards the indulgence of the delinquent in the misconduct\nthe strict rules of Evidence Act and proof beyond reasonable doubt are not applicable to a proceeding of this nature\nthe Supreme Court a decision in Gulabchand is Kudilal AIR 1966 SC 1734 and the decision of the special Court for trial of offences relating to transactions in securities in the matter of National Housing Bank versus ANZ Grindlays Bank 1998 a LJ 153 is relied upon in this regard\na a ORDER now therefore having regard to the nature and gravity of the charges established against Biyani Securities Pvt\nLtd and Shri Harish Biyani a hereby in
